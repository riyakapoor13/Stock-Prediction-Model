1724569420.0,when history rhymes lets cut through the noise patterns in the market dont just happen theyre the echoes of past moves if you know how to read the game you can see when things are about to shift take the us 2year treasury yield for instance look at the charts from 2007 and 2024 what were seeing now is a near replica of where we were back then and if you remember what happened next youll know why this matters 2007 the calm before the storm in september 2007 the yield on the 2year treasury was sitting pretty much where it is now the fed was tightening up pushing rates higher to cool down inflation but underneath all that the housing market was a ticking time bomb and subprime mortgages were the fuse as soon as the cracks started showing the yield took a nosedive the smart money knew what was comingthey got out before the rest of the market caught on the result a crash that rocked the global economy 2024 the echo of 2007 fast forward to 2024 and here we are again the 2year treasury yield is back at those same levels the feds been hiking rates trying to keep inflation under control but this time the threats are broadergeopolitical tensions a shaky global economy and inflation that just wont quit the yield sitting where it is now feels like déjà vu what comes next stay sharp so whats the play if youve been around the block you know that the drop in the 2year yield back in 2007 wasnt just a blipit was the start of something bigger and with the yield at similar levels now its a signal that things could turn south fast this is where you separate the pros from the amateurs dont get caught flatfooted diversify manage your risks and keep an eye on the bigger picture the markets whispering a warning and if youre smart youll listen at the end of the day the 2year treasury yield isnt just another number its a gauge of whats coming and if historys about to repeat itself you better be ready to make your move,Positive,inflation,Reddit

1713331320.0,iranisrael war is devastating for indian stock market israel is still contemplating on how should it respond to iranian drone attacks the idf chief has confirmed that there will certainly be an attack so while we wait i thought of adding my views on what does this war mean from an indian market perspective 1 there is a limited impact on imports and exports from the these two countries for india two points there india has a net positive trade relationship with israel we export more to them than import from them our imports are more in the diamond pearls spacecraft parts and chemicals space this is worth only 2b imports annually india has a net positive trade with iran too also due to us sanctions india does not import any iranian oil 2 however there will be massive impact on broader trade for india think oil the reason for that lies in the strait of hormuz 3 this strait is the worlds busiest oilshipping channel it accounts for 20 of all oil trade and 33 of all lng trade at its narrowest the strait passes entirely through the territorial waters of iran 4 oil tankers from saudi arabia kuwait and iraq have to pass through this strait the worlds largest crude oil port ras tanura of saudi arabia is in this strait 5 as per un convention this strait is part of international waters and cannot be blocked by iran however the iranian army still attacked the indiabound israeli vessel on april 14th 6 this is the fear about disruption of oil supply this fear is driving the speculations in the market this inturn will result in potential price hikes of crude oil and that is what is dangerous for us 7 india is net importer of oil and imports 80 of all their oil needs from outside with russia ukraine war we are able to meet 30 of our needs through cheap russian oil however with the payment problems with russia and houthis attacks in red sea this is no longer an option india has started relying on iraqi oil and saudi arabian oil more both in the strait of hormuz 8 with that a peek on the industries that can potentially feel the heat of war 1 oil marketing companies iocl hpcl bpcl any increase in price of oil will impact the earnings of oil marketing companies in india with the upcoming elections they will not be able to pass this extra cost to the customers however the strong earnings 2 years will help cushion any short term price hikes of upto 90 95 per barrel larger scale of operations and high degree of integration between refining and marketing will allow iocl and bpcl to absorb shocks better than hpcl in addition there is a 30000 crore crore in capital support as per budget that can cover for any cashflow losses 2 paints industry asian paints shalimar paints berger paints indigo paints any time crude prices go up the input costs of paint companies increases crude oil costs account for nearly 40 input costs 3 tyre industry mrf ceat apollo tyres jk tyres the tyre industry uses crude oil derivatives for manufacturing synthetic rubber rise in crude price will hit their input costs and margins 4 fmcg hul itc rising crude oil prices increases the cost of logistics input materials this cost is passed to consumers which reduces consumption any further reduction in rural consumption will hit fmcg companies a lot rising inflation will keep rbi worried 5 railways rvnl ircon jupiter wagons war will slow down indias push towards creating the india middle east europe corridor this corridor is expected to have railway connections too however this corridor also passes through strait of hormuz hope this gives you a nice birds eye view on why the conflict has scared the market on a happier note oil prices first crashed and then stabalized it did not hit the 100 levels yet please check out the link 6 minutes where i further detail this out your feedback will help me course correct and increase the depth of my analysis,Negative,"earnings, inflation",Reddit
1716495542.0,im mostly a lurker on this sub reddit and have noticed the increase in low effort posts recently so i thought for a change id put something that might help new traders deepen their understanding of the mechanics of the market below is a blog post i wrote a few years ago feedback is appreciated why does price move surprisingly or perhaps unsurprisingly most of the people who tradeinvest in financial markets have a tendency to skip the basics of how the markets work one of the most commonly ignored basic aspects is why the market moves in the first place note that why did price move up from this point is a very different question from why did people decide to buy at this point people can buysell for any number of reasons but the interaction between the aggressive and passive participants is what leads to price discovery so why does price move more buyers than sellers definitely not every buy is a sell for any trade to execute the numbers of buyers and sellers must always be equal to each other otherwise there would be no trade less supply than demand this could sometimes be true in the case of stocks because the free float market capitalization amount for any company is a limited number so it is possible that an actual shortage of shares issued by the company may lead to a price hike but its not something you see happen every day and this thinking does not apply to derivatives such as futures and options derivative contracts are mostly used for speculative purposes these days with very little intent of actually taking delivery of the underlying thus the contracts are created and destroyed as and when needed there is no scope of there ever being a contract supply shortage since new contracts are created as trades are executed more desperate buyers than desperate sellers possibly when i say desperate buyers i mean buyers who are willing to transact at a worse price aka at the offer price rather than placing a bid of their own in simple terms these are buyers placing buy market orders as opposed to placing buy limit orders while this explanation is pretty close to the truth it still shows only one side of the coin maybe a better question is what stops price from moving in the first place imagine youre in an apartment building and there is a ceiling above you and a floor below you now if you want to go to the floor above you you will have to break through the ceiling right assuming stairs and elevators dont exist and you have a very solid jump and if you want to go to the floor below you youll have to break the floor underneath your feet so as long as you dont break the ceiling or the floor you are not going anywhere now how quickly you are able to get out of your room is dependent on two things how hard you can hit the ceilingfloor and how thick the ceilingfloor happens to be the floors and ceilings are analogies for bids limit buy and offer limit sell orders respectively they are also called the liquidity in the market thicker markets like bond futures will require a lot of hitting before the floorceiling breaks when compared to thinner markets such as crude oil single stock futures as discussed in the last blog we hit the floorceiling by placing market orders and the market orders eat away the liquidity at a level until it is exhausted at which point we move to the next level this is called the liquidity consumption model imagine after a lot of hitting you finally break the ceiling and go to the floor above you now before you do anything answer this question is it easier to go up or down from here on one hand you can jump up and ram your head against the ceiling above you till it breaks and you can jump to the next floor on the other you can just jump back down to the previous floor through the hole you just created when you came up so as long as the hole is not repaired it will be way easier to come down rather than move up in the above order book note that as you get closer to the current market price the bids and offers get thinner and as you move away from it they get thicker the bids get smaller and smaller the higher you go and when you look above the current market price the number of bids drop to 0 so if lets say someone steps in and places a buy market order of 324 contracts the first 92 will get executed at 17501 and the remaining 232 contracts will get executed at 17502 so we just broke 2 ceilings above our head to get to 17503 since there were no bids initially at 1750017501 and 17502 it will create a liquidity vacuum or a hole in the floor in our analogy which will need to be repaired the vacuum will automatically get repaired over time as buyers come in and start bidding at these levels but for a short duration in time there will be a moment where the offer side liquidity will be extremely thick compared to the bid side liquidity this is what the above will look like after the price jumps up a few floors since the floors are weaker than the ceilings it will be easier to drive the price down than driving up so in case any trader decides to book his profits after the up move it wouldnt take a lot from him to actually drive the prices down again essentially this is what is called a pullback in the market more often than not whenever there is a breakout in the market the market has a tendency to instantly reverse and revisit the level before moving up again allowing for a second entry in the breakout that reverse and revisit is caused by the phenomenon i described above on a price chart this is what it would look like now does it mean every time the market moves up it will lead to push down no but does it make sense for it to do so yep hence this is why markets tend to move in waves on all time frames from the 1 second chart all the way to daily weekly monthly charts this fractal nature of the market is what causes the ebbs and flows across time frames,Positive,,Reddit

1732336303.0,sbfc finance msme lender i started reading up on this business by means of its most recent investment presentation for q2fy25 and witnessed a few things sharing them here any inputs critical view of thought process feedback inputs appreciated if someone has spent time reading through their annual reports previous quarter presentations calls and anything that is worth digging further to develop a better understanding of their business please share business 99 secured book despite that their gnpa is 269 they seem to be lending to a really risky segment but needs further digging their return on assets is really strong at 456 but because they have high capital adequacy ratio 386 crar their overall return on equity is in low double digits 1267 the business is currently valued at over 3x the book value but if they increase their gearing ratio leverage thereby reducing their adequacy ratio crar they might be able to scale up their return on equity and hence profitability remains to be seen what are their growth targets and whether they are sustainable concerns asset quality given their book is 99 secured gnpa 269 nnpa 163 credit cost 095 low provision coverage ratio 4017 average ticket size is quite high meaning a low number of customers can really spike the asset quality unless they scale this rapidly enough basically high ticket size with high volumes such that small customers dont have the ability to take away profits by being delinquent delayed on their payments the yield of 1764 on secured lending seems worrisome why cant customers run away to more established lenders or at least small finance banks after a year or twos consistent payment thereby showcasing their ability to pay cost of funds is high as compared to a small finance bank 933 meaning they will be forced to lend at high rates thereby either sticking to low quality in customers but doing high ticket sizes so higher chances of large delinquencies or considerably bringing down their yield hence profitability return ratios earnings call q2fy25 in this environment the challenge isnt the bounce rates going up but the challenge has been once the customer slips to bring the customer back has become that much extra difficult the the environment has become tighter and now in the current market environment usually what happens is that when unsecured lenders tighten the belts the secured lenders do face some impact which naturally comes thereafter the difficulty to bring the customer back once slip once he goes to 60 dpd then he keeps being stable but we find it difficult to bring him back to normalcy which was a little easier earlier q you also mentioned your cost of funding going up which is fair but incrementally are we able to really pass it on to customers because i think in the 1st phase of the rate hike you are able to maintain your spreads very well do you see that incrementally while the cost is going up its a challenge to pass it on response we have a category of customers which range anything between 5 lakhs to 30odd lakhs and towards the higher end of the ticket sizes and for the higher end is 15 lakhs and above we tend to cooriginate those loans which effectively means that only 20 of those loans are with us and 80 is with the cooriginating partner if you look at even our current quarter you would see coorigination as a percentage is at 17odd and the balance is on the sbfc book so you would see a positive impact there largely the book is on a variable rate so our ability to pass on is extremely high on the book concern they are already yielding close to 18 on secured lending property and gold and they see further increase in rates due to the cost of funds going up how sustainable is this these are inching close to microfinance rates for secured lending this concern is further emphasised by management mentioning that it usually takes them 1012 working days to finalise decision to lend whereas in unsecured the turnaround is quite rapid within a few days in fact i will be very worried if someone wants me to say a yes or no in 24 hours so by default probably my answer is going to be no so we really dont want to lend up in a hurry and then take a long time collecting it so in secured there are multiple things that go in before we decision it while a financial decision is relatively easy provided he has all the documents together but that seldom happens for an average 10 lakh customer the second part that the time taking part is the property details which is respect to legal or title so thereabout we would take close to around 10 working days to 12 working days to finally decision and hand out the money to the customer so unlike unsecured secured does go through a bit of detailing before we hand out the money to the customer so for a customer who is given money at very high rates why would they stick around if they can get a loan from a small finance bank rather quickly at almost similar interest rates or maybe even lower as the small finance banks cost of funds would be much lower aseem dhru mentions this challenge maintaining margins is going to be a key challenge and as banks nims come under pressure nbfc nims will also come under pressure our ability to manage is what will get tested that passing rate increases to customers is of course an option available we have a variable portfolio but we also have to be cognizant of the fact that we deal with customers who are vulnerable to emi increases so we dont want to do it as much as possible we will do it if we have to but as much as possible we would rather find innovative ways to reduce our cost of fund we have diversified our holding away from banks we have been continuously dropping our percentage borrowing from banks and we have gone to the ncd market which is giving us a better yield we are now going to raise it from multilateral financial institutions shortly so we have to find ways to battle it q customer segment response its not that there is a whole hoard of customers that have fallen in it is just that the regular customers who used to bounce and pay their ability to collect has declined to some extent only within that cohort of customers and when two emis pile up it becomes a little difficult for the customer to pay 2 emis because of course see the postpandemic inflation has been quite substantial and the incomes havent really kept pace so its very logical and we are not dealing with the topend of customers in the space we are dealing with customers who are managing to keep their ends meet so there is a demand on their incomes more than what their incomes are in line also small businesses have their own challenges as india gets more organised some of the small businesses find the competitive intensity quite a lot and today if you see corporate results they show pain of growth now obviously that same growth is also affecting the small businesses its just that they dont come in newspapers and there is no data readily available as to what impact they have so nothing really dramatic it is just that a slight slowdown in their income or a slight increase in their cost they find it a little difficult to service but these come back these are cycles they will be brought back it will take some time but they will all be brought back since they do secured lending overall loss of money is quite lowinsignificant in secured assets overall in the last three years we have just written off around 10 12 crores so its immaterial to that extent in unsecured portfolio we would have done some writeoffs but thats a rundown portfolio now only 55 crores is left so from an overall perspective there has been hardly any writeoffs q on increasing leverage response liabilities are more than plenty i dont think there is any challenge of liabilities in the market also if you see while the mclrs are going up and the cost of borrowing in the markets are going up but we have been able to maintain our cost of borrowing so that also in a way says that since we have enough liquidity our ability to negotiate and bargain a good price is there so i think there is no problem from a liquidity point of view your other question as to in terms of leverage you are absolutely right as we go along the entire growth is going to be funded through debt till the time we achieve a respectable leverage the reason you are seeing sometimes in a quartertoquarter basis is there is a profit which also kicks in which adds to the net worth of the company and thats the reason the leverage sometimes may look optically similar but all the growth is getting funded through debt we are sitting on a lot more cash than we need to just to ensure that we have a good nights sleep so we are sitting on excess liquidity so that also is a factor q rbi declined hfc application policy level decision nothing against sbfc finance rbi doesnt want a regulated entity under another regulated entity q several participants asked questions about business model business fundamentals helpful to hear that to build understanding of the businessi started reading up on this business by means of its most recent investment presentation for q2fy25 and witnessed a few things sharing them here any inputs critical view of thought process feedback inputs appreciated if someone has spent time reading through their annual reports previous quarter presentations calls and anything that is worth digging further to develop a better understanding of their business please share business 99 secured book despite that their gnpa is 269 they seem to be lending to a really risky segment but needs further digging their return on assets is really strong at 456 but because they have high capital adequacy ratio 386 crar their overall return on equity is in low double digits 1267 the business is currently valued at over 3x the book value but if they increase their gearing ratio leverage thereby reducing their adequacy ratio crar they might be able to scale up their return on equity and hence profitability remains to be seen what are their growth targets and whether they are sustainable concerns asset quality given their book is 99 secured gnpa 269 nnpa 163 credit cost 095 low provision coverage ratio 4017 average ticket size is quite high meaning a low number of customers can really spike the asset quality unless they scale this rapidly enough basically high ticket size with high volumes such that small customers dont have the ability to take away profits by being delinquent delayed on their payments the yield of 1764 on secured lending seems worrisome why cant customers run away to more established lenders or at least small finance banks after a year or twos consistent payment thereby showcasing their ability to pay cost of funds is high as compared to a small finance bank 933 meaning they will be forced to lend at high rates thereby either sticking to low quality in customers but doing high ticket sizes so higher chances of large delinquencies or considerably bringing down their yield hence profitability return ratios earnings call q2fy25 in this environment the challenge isnt the bounce rates going up but the challenge has been once the customer slips to bring the customer back has become that much extra difficult the the environment has become tighter and now in the current market environment usually what happens is that when unsecured lenders tighten the belts the secured lenders do face some impact which naturally comes thereafter

1725978935.0,deep value investment elnet technologies consistent operating history with diversified clientele incorporated in 1990 etl is one of the first it parks developed in chennai on a land measuring 316 acres the land was handed over for development of it park through a government order in 1991 and the commercial operations begun in 1996 the it park has a leasable space of 230 lac sqft and has been leased out to multiple small and midsized players the it park has a stable track record of operations and the overall occupancy level of the property continues to remain strong at 90 as on september 30 2023 elnet averaged 137 return on equity and 372 return on capital employed from 2015 through 2024 the client base is mostly small and midsized players with majority of them being backend service and support providers in itites to various industries average floor area of the it park ranges from 3500 sq ft to 10000 sq ft major tenants include sterling software quintessence business solutions and services pvt ltd crayon data india pvt ltd karur vysya bank information dynamics india etc favourable location and longterm prospects of it park the it park is located in the region encompassing taramani and thiruvanmiyur on old mahabalipuram road omr which is known as the it hub of chennai the region has emerged as a preferred office destination by the itites sector concentrated by top global players in the industry its proximity to the city centre easy access to the airport availability of good quality office buildings good connectivity by roads rail mrts developed social infrastructure and presence of key residential areas in its vicinity are key demand contributors to attract major itites occupiers elnet gross income increased by 15x to inr 34 crores whereas its profit increased 3x to inr 175 crores from 2015 through 2024 the possibility of elnet failing in the long term is abysmal in the last 3 decade they were able to ride the wave of it revolution however in the future if there is another revolution still they will be leasing there offices to other industries like renewable sector and startup ecosystem they have advantage that they only cater to small and midsized players and when the small companies turn big they move to bigger areas and if they dont still they need small offices to operate contrary to other it park which is in the proximity to larger ones like ramanujam it city 45 lac sqft and tidel park 128 lac sqft which offer wider floor plates and premium facilitiesamenities have a huge chances of unoccupancy in the recession and tough times as mncs cut costs and layoff their employees elnet is partly mitigated by prime location of the asset competitive rate longterm stickiness of clients and steady occupancy levels additionally the concentration risk is low due to diverse tenants occupying the premises and no particular tenant is occupying more than 15 of the total leasable area also elnet has no plans to expand or built new infrastructure capital reinvestment and working capital needs are minor and working capital investments are nonexistent thus elnet produces above average returns on capital and generate substantial cash in excess of their operating needs healthy occupancy levels the occupancy level of the asset continues to remain strong at 90 as on september 30 2023 as corporates continued to remain committed towards work from officehybrid model over work from home in the past three fiscals the occupancy level stood strong over 85 considering strong occupancy level the company continues to enjoy consistent revenue stream with total operating income of inr 26 crore and profit margin of 51 the lease agreements are generally for a period of 35 years with a lockin period of 15 years with inbuilt escalation clause of lease rent hike of 5 every year profit margin has doubled to 51 in 2024 from 24 in 2015 contribution from interest income from the deposits partly offset by the low cost structure of the company as of fy24 the company has on its roll fourteen employees excluding managing director and the rest of the operations are carried through outsourcing comfortable capital structure the company has not availed any longterm loans or working capital facility as on march 31 2024 the total debt outstanding is 426 crore in the form of unsecured loans availed from the group entity stur technologies currently there are no plans to avail additional debt and hence financial risk profile of the company is expected to remain comfortable while there are no expansion plans in consideration the company may undertake new projects in medium term and hence its impact on the capital structure remains monitorable liquidity the liquidity profile of the etl is adequate with sufficient cash accruals as against no longterm repayment obligations the company holds cash and cash equivalent of close to inr 1115 crore mainly in the form of bank fixed deposits as of march 2024 the company does not have any debt with the working capital requirements being met by internal accruals without any debt value from 2013 to 2024 elnet technologies earned inr 115 crore for its owners from these earnings company paid shareholders inr 767 crore in dividend and retained 107 crore in april 2013 the total market value of the company was inr 14 crore as of now market value had grown to 148 crore over the 12 year period for every inr 100 the company retained it created inr 125 in market value for shareholders as of 5th september the total market value for the elnet technologies is inr 148 crore we will start by calculating the free cash flow ie pat 1749 plus noncash charges plus da minus capital expenditures minus other income 827 yielding fcf of inr 922 crore assumption in the long term da and capital expenditure will remain same if we divide fcf by long term india government bond yield 7 plus 2 premium the value of future cash flow is inr 1024 crore adding the present value of 1024 crore with the cash lying on the balance sheet of 1115 crore gives the value of inr 214 crore ie upside of 44 from current market value of 148 crore 214 crore value is the most conservative as the discount rate used here is 9 including 2 premium warren buffet dismisses the concept of equity risk premium because it is an artifact of the capital asset pricing model that uses price volatility as a measure of risk in simple terms higher the price volatility the higher the equity risk premium buffet thinks the whole idea that price volatility is a measure of risk is nonsense in his mind business risk is reduced by focusing on companies with consistent and predictable earnings given that elnet technologies have consistent and predictable earnings using the discount rate of long term india government bond yield 7 will give valuation of inr 246 crore and if we take one more assumption that the company can grow its fcf 922 by 2 this will give the value of inr 300 crore which is double from the current market value further value can be unlocked through an increase in dividend though this is at the discretion of the management key weaknesses renewal risk of lease contracts etl has entered into lease agreements with various tenants with most of them ranging for a term period of 35 years with the lockin period of 15 years post this the tenants have an option to terminate the lease agreement by giving 6 months notice without any charges in next 12 months lease contracts for more than 25 of occupied area are due for renewal hence company is exposed to the renewal risk for these contracts however demonstrated track record of renewals in the past mitigates the risk to a large extent according to the care ratings majority of the tenants have carried out their own fitouts which enhances the tenant stickiness counterparty risk the company is exposed to the counterparty risk as majority of the tenants are small and midsized itites players providing backend support services to various industries however comfort is drawn from the fact that the company undertakes necessary due diligence of each tenant before entering into a lease agreement and securing 10 months rental as security deposit in respect of majority of the tenants as on march 31 2024 etl holds cancellable and noncancellable deposits related to lease rentals to the tune of inr 13

1722466767.0,is the indian government using capital gains tax to influence the stock market in the recent indian budget announcement a significant point of discussion has been the hike in capital gains tax to 20 this increase has sparked debates and speculation about the governments intentions behind this move some analysts and investors wonder whether this is a deliberate strategy to influence the stock markets trajectory lets delve into this intriguing question the capital gains tax hike a quick overview capital gains tax is levied on the profit realized from the sale of assets like stocks bonds or real estate in india the government recently raised the shortterm capital gains stcg tax rate from 15 to 20 and lowered the longterm capital gains ltcg tax rate from 20 to 125 up from previous levels this hike in stcg is substantial and affects a wide range of investors from individuals to large institutional players the possible impact on the stock market 1 reduced selling pressure a higher capital gains tax can discourage investors from selling their assets too quickly as the tax eats into their profits by holding onto their investments longer they avoid paying the higher tax rate potentially leading to less selling pressure in the market this could help maintain or even drive up stock prices as fewer shares are being sold off 2 encouraging longterm investment the governments move could be interpreted as a nudge towards longterm investment by making it more costly to realize shortterm gains the policy incentivizes investors to think longterm which could lead to more stable and sustained market growth 3 revenue generation vs market stability while the primary aim of a tax hike is usually to increase government revenue its worth considering whether there could be a secondary objective the indian government like others might benefit from showcasing a thriving stock market as a sign of economic strength a rising market not only boosts investor confidence but also reflects well on the governments economic management is there a hidden agenda the idea that the government might be using tax policy as a tool to influence the stock market is speculative but not entirely unfounded governments often use fiscal policies to achieve broader economic goals by implementing a higher capital gains tax the indian government could be subtly encouraging market stability and growth which in turn makes the economy look robust to both domestic and international observers however its crucial to consider the broader economic context the indian economy like many others is navigating a complex postpandemic recovery landscape the government may be looking to ensure a steady flow of revenue while also maintaining investor confidence in the market a buoyant stock market can help in raising capital encouraging investment and stimulating economic activity conclusion while its impossible to say definitively whether the indian government is using the capital gains tax hike as a tool to control the stock market the implications are worth considering the policy could indeed contribute to reduced volatility and encourage a more stable investment environment whether by design or as a beneficial side effect this move aligns with the broader goal of fostering longterm economic growth investors should keep an eye on how these policies evolve and continue to assess their impact on both their portfolios and the market as a whole as with any fiscal policy the full effects will only become apparent over time and it will be interesting to see how this unfolds in the indian economic landscape,Positive,bse,Reddit

1664705565.0,gold loans a new world order muthoot and manappuram are two of the largest gold loan nbfcs in india with 23rds of the nbfc gold loan market covered between them both businesses are highly profitable with roas as high as sbis credit card business if you are a longterm shareholder in these companies youd have been happy with the returns up until last year muthoot and manappuram shares delivered 215 and 65 respectively from 2017 through 2021 but things havent been good in the past year both companys shares have dropped between 3040 yoy profits shrank as per the latest results and aums have flattened over the last 3 quarters what changed recently interestingly covid banks teasers and the rbi all have a role to play in the answer to that question with that context lets jump right in and unpack whats going on muthoot manappuram then and now business overview both muthoot and manappuram are nbfcs focused on gold loans largely catering to underserved rural and semiurban markets in india while both entities have been diversifying into other lending segments gold loans still constitute a significant portion of their aum and profits also both companies originated in the southern part of india kerala but have been working on building a panindia presence together these two entities control 23rds of the nbfc gold market here are some stats on them x200b as a next step lets look at the economics of the gold lending business given the underserved focus these businesses have strong pricing power translating into high yields high nims and nearzero loss rates due to the secured nature of the loan note that per rbi guidelines gold loans are capped at 75 loan to value ltv this makes gold loans extremely low risk for two reasons 1 liquid collateral if you dont pay back the lender can easily liquidate your jewelry to recover the loan amount this is unlike a home loan another secured loan where selling a house is a longer tougher process for the lender 2 protection against volatility we know that gold is a volatile commodity but note that the lender has a 25 buffer via the 75 ltv since gold loans are typically shortterm loans its even lower risk given its fairly unlikely for gold prices to drop by 25 in short time periods lets look at some numbers for muthoot and manappuram x200b 25 roes are a rare phenomena based on the data above both businesses appear to have very attractive economics but that seems to have changed in the last year recent performance both companies have lost between 3040 of their market cap in the last year x200b this isnt surprising if you look at some of the key performance drivers clearly somethings going on lets understand what in the next sections gold loans during covid what worked for nbfcs first gold prices went up a phenomenon common during recessions given golds status as a recessionary hedge second demand for loans went up during covid and more households in india pledged their gold to take loans thereby increasing the demand for gold loans as a result both manappuram and muthoot did really well here are some stats to demonstrate this what didnt work for nbfcs but something else happened too the rbi hiked ltv caps from 75 to 90 this was a temporary measure to increase liquidity in the system which made logical sense at the time as a result banks really doubled down on the gold loans segment during fy21 covid aftermath competition the 7590 ltv hike nudged a lot of banks to grow their gold lending businesses with banks entering this segment the gold lending space became very competitive note that fy21 had enough gold demand to absorb the credit supply from the new banking players entering the space but as gold prices and loan demand tapered off in fy22 nbfcs struggled to compete with banks here is a very powerful chart summarizing exactly what happened yields average loan interest rates for both businesses dropped drastically in fy22 this happened because both companies gave out teaser rates as low as 69 per annum to attract customers and that was the only way manappuram and muthoot could compete with banks given banks were charging between 712 which they could afford given their low cost of funds x200b clearly its impossible for these two nbfcs to compete with banks on interest rates but the management of both companies seem to think that the bank competition is a temporary phenomenon driven by the ltv hike during covid that will taper off going forward well were not entirely convinced given the way some banks are growing their gold portfolios based on the gold loan aum numbers of banks over the last few quarters it doesnt seem to us like banks are going to slow down they might be here to stay with banks making headway in the gold loan space do you think gold loan nbfcs are going to continue to struggle to grow compete full analysis here,Positive,"sbi, interest rates",Reddit

come the fed has clearly signaled aggressive rate hikes to battle inflation this battle might cause a recession not only in the us but in other developed economies with high levels of inflation as well the rbi has followed the fed though the quantum of our rate hikes have been lower however even if the global economy enters a recession india is very well positioned weve done a great job of keeping inflation under control and our gdp is estimated to grow by 74 in fy23 imf estimates but its not just inflation control there is more to cheer about our banking ecosystem has never been better with npas at multiyear lows banks are well positioned to accelerate the credit growth engine this time we think the growth cycle will be different read on to learn why banking sector the past and the present lending in the past 2 decades corporate lending growth blow up lets start with how the banking ecosystem has evolved over the last 15 years post the great recession of 2008 corporate lending saw significant growth in india and this happened at the expense of retail lending here is a chart demonstrating corporate lending growth between 20092013 this growth in corporate lending led to significant risk increases in bank corporate loan books this was due to a combination of inefficient underwriting by banks and corporates over leveraging themselves here is a chart showing gnpa numbers across the largest set of banks in india pca framework this forced rbi to put a bunch of banks under the prompt corrective action pca framework the pca assessed banks across three parameters losses npa capital crar and returns roa once a bank enters pca they arent allowed to grow their books until they get their house in order ie bring risk levels down capitalize their balance sheet and start making profits growth in retail lending given the corporate lending blow up the banking ecosystem reduced their exposure towards corporate loans and moved towards retail lending retail penetration ramped up significantly from 2015 on the banking industry today the banking ecosystem has cleaned up house over the last several years and gnpa has come down to multiyear lows here are gnpa levels for the largest public and private sector banks x200b all banks put under the pca framework have now exited the framework the last one to exit was central bank of india cbi lets look at the gnpas for some of the banks that were in the pca framework while these banks still have work to do their asset quality has seen significant improvement over the last few years x200b with low gnpas across the banking ecosystem banks have the appetite for credit growth over the next few years the last cycle of growth came from retail lending where will this cycle of growth come from retail growth driven by unsecured lending given the low gnpa levels across the board banks have the appetite to absorb risk so banks with good asset quality are well positioned to take bets in the unsecured retail space including credit cards and unsecured personal loans and this is exactly what larger private banks like kotak axis and icici are doing here is a snapshot of their retail segment growth in q1fy23 and unsecured lending has seen a large spike in the last few months with gnpa numbers bottoming out we expect this trend to continue over the next few years we not only see retail growing from here on but also expect the retail mix of unsecured loans and credit cards to meaningfully increase corporate growth driven by the twin balance sheet clean up firstly corporate demand is back which means demand for credit is going to increase to demonstrate this lets look at industry level capacity utilization cu as the name suggests this metric represents the of manufacturing capacity utilized for production higher the cu higher the demand and higher the need for capital investment and therefore higher credit need x200b corporates have significantly deleveraged their balance sheets here is some data to back this up x200b so not just banks corporates have also cleaned up their balance sheets this twin balance sheet cleanup makes corporate lending an attractive proposition for banks at this time msme growth driven by postpandemic recovery clearly msme risk recovery hasnt happened across the board while risk levels for private banks seem to have come back to prepandemic levels psus and nbfcs still have some more cleaning up to do given this we expect private sector banks to grow their msme books and this seems to be happening the world might be facing an impending recession but we dont think india is not only are our banks well positioned to grow over the next several years but we expect this growth to benefit all segments retail msme and corporate what do you think about our

1640866434.0,indian stock market rally made investors richer by rs 72 lakh crore in 2021 as if wanting to be an antidote to the coronavirus pandemic the indian stock market adorned carnival robes in 2021 with a tsunami of liquidity unleashed by global central banks coupled with supportive domestic policies and the worlds largest vaccination drive sparking off a worldbeating rally on dalal street despite bouts of uneasiness over fizzy valuations while the wider economy shuttled between recovery and relapse dictated by multiple mutations of the virus equity market benchmarks appeared headed in just one direction skywards the dizzying upward journey has added a whopping rs 72 lakh crore during 2021 to investors wealth measured as the cumulative value of all listed shares in the country taking it to nearly rs 260 lakh crore in indian stock market the bse sensex made history this year by breaching the 50000mark for the first time ever and went on to scale the 60000 level within the next seven months it closed at its lifetime high of 6176559 on october 18 despite the yearend gyrations due to the omicron threat the 30share benchmark has posted returns of nearly 20 per cent so far this year eclipsing most of its global peers however sensex is also the most expensive large market in the world trading at a pricetoearnings ratio of 2711 this means investors are paying rs 2711 for every rupee of future earnings of the 30 sensex firms compared to its previous 20year average of 1980 but the indian market is not the only one witnessing such exuberance global central banks led by the us federal reserve have pumped in trillions of dollars into the financial markets since the onset of the pandemic to boost liquidity and prop up growth the us fed has been buying bonds worth usd 120 every month for the past oneandahalf years nearly doubling its balance sheet to an astounding usd 83 trillion this unprecedented sea of liquidity has induced what experts have termed the everything bubble an acrosstheboard increase in asset prices be it stocks real estate or commodities not to mention more exotic instruments like cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens nfts back home the government and the rbi worked in tandem to reignite the animal spirit of the pandemicbattered economy the reserve bank has kept the policy rate at an alltime low of 4 per cent since may last year while reiterating its commitment to maintaining an accommodative stance as long as required the centre unleashed a slew of big bang reforms including productionlinked incentive schemes for multiple sectors a rs 100 lakhcrore pm gati shakti master plan for infrastructure development and an ambitious asset monetisation pipeline among various other measures all this played out amid a colossal vaccination drive which enabled the reopening of the economy after the shock of covid19 lockdowns the year started on a wave of optimism with the start of the vaccination program and the sharp revival of the economy however the intensity of the second wave tempered some of this initial optimism this was soon followed by the return of inflation led primarily by supply chain disruptions said nitin raheja executive director head discretionary equities julius baer however strong commitment on the part of central banks both globally and domestically towards ensuring strong revival in growth through the continuation of easy money policies saw liquidity remaining benign fuelling strong inflows into financial markets and other risky assets he noted multiyear lowinterest rates new generation reforms adequate availability of capital and the revival of the real estate sector have created the framework for a multiyear earnings growth cycle raheja added despite all these factors in favour the market has a habit of teaching some very old lessons to some very new investors one such lesson was that valuations and fundamentals matter as evidenced by the disastrous market debut of paytm the rs 18300crore ipo indias largest was one of the most hyped listings in recent times and a major milestone in the countrys startup ecosystem however in indian stock market the stock crashed 27 per cent on the very first day and continued sinking in subsequent sessions currently trading in the range of rs 1360 the stock is yet to touch its issue price of rs 2150 that apart the coronavirus remains an unpredictable adversary for investors worldwide just when countries had started reopening and the global economy was getting back on track the highlycontagious omicron variant emerged triggering a fresh wave of cases and border restrictions with soaring inflation playing havoc with economies the world over central banks too have started to dial back their stimulus measures the fed has already begun tapering its bondbuying and will wind down the quantitative easing program by early next year to be followed by rate hikes the bank of england earlier this month became the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the onset of the pandemic the tightening of ultraloose monetary policies has subsequently led to a flight of foreign capital from emerging markets including india after being net investors for the most part of the year fpis have been on a selling spree since october offloading shares worth rs 37320 crore as of december 24 the relentless selling pressure however has been partially offset by a growing force in the domestic financial landscape the retail investor inflows from systematic investment plans sips crossed the rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time this year as per data from the association of mutual funds in india amfi individual investors hold a higher share of the mf industry assets 549 per cent in november 2021 compared to 515 per cent in the same month last year not only that 77 per cent of individual investor assets are held in equityoriented schemes in indian stock market the investors are not shying away from direct participation in the equity markets as well while the number of demat accounts stood at 409 crore at the end of 201920 and 551 crore in 202021 the figure has already swelled to 738 crore this fiscal so far as of october 31 2021 the aftermath of the worlds biggest ever easy monetary policy and fiscal expenditure made equities attractive and the equity market benefited even more as the economy reopened increased money inflows in the financial system bought foreign money to emerging markets the cascading effect of profits bought retail investors to the equity market a global affair indirectly pandemic did help some indian economy sectors like it healthcare and exporters which benefited from digitalization and global demand said vinod nair head of research at geojit financial services adhering to the adage of making hay while the sun shines indian inc too piled into the capital market with initial public offers ipos raising a recordshattering rs 118 lakh crore from over 60 issues also read nifty hits record 18000 for first time ever what investors should do now the street saw more initial share sales in 2021 than in the year past three years combined both in terms of the number of listings and the amount raised with such high spirits all around many market participants are asking themselves an uncomfortable question how long will the good times last most brokerages expect sensex to post tepid returns in 2022 weighed by the already stretched valuations hawkish central banks and an uncertain global recovery the looming threat of omicron setting off another wave of the pandemic is the biggest shortterm risk but faith in the underlying india story remains intact we think strong growth forecast in the medium term should support the valuations we like the stability
