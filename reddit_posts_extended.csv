Is Jio price Hike fair? And does it make it a monopoly?,134,1dqu7e4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1dqu7e4/is_jio_price_hike_fair_and_does_it_make_it_a/,1719608583.0,98,"EDIT: It‚Äôs a pro Jio post and got hate because people assumed it‚Äôs a hate post and didn‚Äôt even read. I tried to give a different POV from the other Jio monopoly posts (generic stuff about how you‚Äôre the product if it‚Äôs free) 
Will delete the post. But could‚Äôve read more than just the title and commenting on that basis.

I‚Äôm just trying to bring a different POV. I might be wrong, happy to learn!

We all look at Jio and call it a monopoly business model, where eventually they‚Äôll get all the users hooked to their service and have no other option available.

1. Bur what exactly will keep us hooked to Jio? 
Service and pricing, if that deteriorates people will switch. Unlike google and Facebook that are irreplaceable because they are the product itself. Jio is just a service provider. 

2. telecom is a very capital intensive industry. 
Look around the globe, all major economies have 3-4 major internet providers like India.
Germany, USA, Australia, Korea, Japan, UK. 
And hence our internet penetration only grew by 1.5% from 2011 to 2018 and then by 6-8% each year.
And consolidation is essential for internet to be accessible for all. Because prior to Jios entry we had 7-8 major players.
Result no economy of scale hence Internet was still accessible in urban areas mostly.
(Where most of the reddit users come from )

3. Jio and others hiked prices after 3 years, adjusted for inflation most plans are at the same cost and they have put immense capital for 5G

4. India still has one of the lowest if not the lowest per gb cost, one month plan is still less than 10 rs per GB
Pre jio it was 250 rs per GB so even if they increase prices by 2000% it‚Äôll be still cheaper than what people paid back in 2017 not even adjusted for inflation.

5. Without jios entry
- No UPI
- No gaming companies
- no e-commerce and quick commerce penetration 
- no viable market for social media in India
- no UPI based companies
- Insanely difficult WFH during COVID 
- No Product managers, Programmatic managers, Business Analyst, Developers insane salary growth and requirement in the market.
- no OTT
- No music streaming 

Basically no user level data.

Jio has democratised knowledge and learning, has made technology accessible to remotest part of INDIA.

Sure the Govt helped Jio and Ambani initially but they also made sure not to let VI go completely bust by converting debt to equity without voting rights, making sure to not convert VI to another BSNL and PSU.
If we have 3-4 players in the market, we should be fine just like the rest of the world.

I think we forget what it was like prior to 2017 and how I used to switch 2G to check WhatsApp messages and never watched a video on YouTube without making sure it wasn‚Äôt running on anything above 360p
And now I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs 720p or 1080p

Now we get connectivity even during complete train and bus journeys. 
No need to keep things downloaded for journeys (expect air travel)

I think most of it was not required at all. I could have understand FnO taxation hike but equity tax hike makes no sense.

I believe the small cap and mid cap traction will reduce from a swing trading point of view.

Blue chip funds will get more traction now.

Governor Shaktikanta Das will probably announce on Oct. 8 a 15 basis point increase in the rate at which banks park excess cash with the Reserve Bank of India, economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar Zaidi wrote in a note Thursday. At the same time, Das would reiterate that policy will keep supporting growth for an extended period of time, they added.

‚ÄúIncreasing size and cutoff rates of recent variable rate reverse repo auctions might have indicated RBI‚Äôs willingness to normalize liquidity operations earlier than expected,‚Äù the economists said. ‚ÄúWith the pandemic induced ‚Äòemergency‚Äô behind us, there is lesser need of continuing with the exceptional policy of keeping the reverse repo as the operative rate.‚Äù

The outlier call from Citi follows the RBI‚Äôs decision Tuesday, when it surprised markets by setting the 7-day reverse repo cutoff at 3.99%, 57 basis points higher than the previous auction and just a shade lower than the central bank‚Äôs policy rate of 4%. Indian stocks, which had been rallying on expectations of continued cheap cash, fell after the Citi forecast was published.

The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was trading down 0.4% as of 1:46 p.m. in Mumbai, compared with a 0.1% gain in the Asia Pacific Index.

The RBI may also increase the duration of its variable rate reverse repos beyond 14-days and bring down its bond purchases under the government securities acquisition program for the next quarter to 500 billion rupees or lower, the Citi economists said.

Too much retail money is flowing into the markets. To individual stocks and via mutual funds. So if I‚Äôm in a position of power or I have a lot of money. My investment would make less sense and the average retail investor would be making better returns than a millionaire.

How do the ultra rich and Banks and therefore government stop this and keep all the money to themselves? Ultimately they are the market and policy makers

1.	‚Å†FM Sitharaman may increase the tax on CAPITAL GAINS both LTCG and STCG. I‚Äôm pretty much certain this will happen in the next budget.(post election)

2.	‚Å†NSE/BSE will hike their charges for futures and options drastically . May be lesser for stocks. TAXES / stamp duties will also increase.

3. Mutual funds will increase their expense ratios back by policy Rejig and regulations. 

4.	‚Å†There may be an crash, it may dramaticised to such an extent that the average retail investor like you and me will remove all our money from the markets. There will be a play like there‚Äôs blood on the streets. Then at the lowest point the ultra rich will pump in all the money. The low will be lower than the low you have in mind. 

It‚Äôs easy in a bull market to say, I‚Äôm in it for the long term. Just ride the low and pump in more money at lows. Any retail investor will do that. But most will run out money after a YEAR OR TWO. You will start thinking about taking money out since you‚Äôre getting only negative returns. That‚Äôs when the ultra rich enter. 

MARKETS NEVER FAVOUR THE AVERAGE RETAIL INVESTOR. Markets are made by the ultra rich and it will always favour them. MARKETS is not an EQUAL GROUND. They just spin you the story but it is definitely not a fair ground.

This all only a PROBABILTY. But it‚Äôs not like it has never happened. "

While this further reduces the need for the Federal Reserve to maintain large interest rate cuts at its remaining two meetings this year, it does come across as a great relief to those fearing an economic slowdown in the US.

How will this impact us? Currently, there are 5 inter-related major factors that are influencing our markets.

1. US interest rate cuts (and slowdown fears)
2. Japan's new Prime Minister and his stance on BOJ's monetary policy
3. Tension in the Middle East
4. China stimulus
5. Prices of commodities (primarily crude oil)

With US downturn fears fading away, and Japan's new PM's dovish rate comments; these can be considered as early or momentary signs of a brief (if not elaborate) turnaround.

Edit: Before you judge me, keep in mind the reason of my post. I‚Äôm not asking y‚Äôall why the stock isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdoubling‚Äù or ‚Äúcrashing‚Äù, I‚Äôm just asking why the ***weekly*** returns are diminished when the market is in rally and competitors are doing well. 

I‚Äôm well aware how the stock has progressed and done well and fyi I‚Äôm still in profit considering I bought it last year at much lower price. I‚Äôm simply asking why it‚Äôs tanking ***this week***."
"14-15 years are left for my daughter to reach 18. Investments done in MF, Sukanya, FD etc. Please suggest long term stocks options for potentially big returns.",49,18s6l5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/18s6l5v/1415_years_are_left_for_my_daughter_to_reach_18/,1703699568.0,66,"34M here. 

When it comes to investments, I have gone heavy into equity MFs, FDs, Gold, schemes like PPFs, Sukanya Samridhi schemes etc but for some reason have shied away from direct stocks. 

I have the risk appetite now. 
In specific, I do want to start off with the college education/future of my kid who is 3. 

I had already put in good amounts/started investing in other places such as 

1. Sukanya Samridhi maxed out to give 62L at maturity. 
2. MFs earmarked for higher education- Lumpsum and SIPs. Mostly into Nifty50 but one or two others too there. This will continue based on how much I can do. 
3. Gold

Yes we are in parallel planning for our old age too in retirements through MFs, PPFs, Real estate investments and have good life and health insurance coverage too. 

Reg school: I started saving for her school when she was 3 months old and will be soon meeting the target of school fees till 12th adjusted for inflation/hikes through investments. This milestone itself would be a big relief. 

Now coming to the question, if the experts here can suggest some stocks that can potentially give massive returns - some high risk and some large cap good bets that can potentially give a big upside to the portfolio should things work out. 

Over the next 1-2 years I wanted to invest lumpsum into such stocks and hold for very long (about 15 years). 

Of the 10-15% of the entire efforts of investment for the kid, I was thinking of

1. 40% of lumpsum into 
US stocks like Amazon, Apple, Alphabet etc - betting on these growing to even more massive levels in 15 years

2. 30% of lumpsum into-
 Indian large caps like Tata steel, Reliance Jio etc -Betting on those who will dominate in the India growth story of the next 1-2 decades

3. 30% of lumpsum into-
Midcap companies that have excellent foundation and are bound to grow- These will be the biggest risk but if it clicks can mean crores. 

Sorry to sound like bit of a Noob here. 

Please advice on the strategy and stocks to pick. 
I know there is no magical formula and nothing is guaranteed but the idea is to park monies in areas of potentially massive growth too. 

Will keep an eye on these of course and cut losses should such a day arise. 

Really appreciate any inputs."

Patterns in the market don‚Äôt just happen; they‚Äôre the echoes of past moves. If you know how to read the game, you can see when things are about to shift. Take the US 2-Year Treasury yield, for instance. Look at the charts from 2007 and 2024. What we‚Äôre seeing now is a near replica of where we were back then. And if you remember what happened next, you‚Äôll know why this matters.

https://preview.redd.it/1om354f7erkd1.png?width=2746&format=png&auto=webp&s=c64d62ca6b455dbc5b98539fed7f2bc8e5d60d38

# 2007: The Calm Before the Storm

In September 2007, the yield on the 2-Year Treasury was sitting pretty much where it is now. The Fed was tightening up, pushing rates higher to cool down inflation. But underneath all that, the housing market was a ticking time bomb, and subprime mortgages were the fuse. As soon as the cracks started showing, the yield took a nosedive. The smart money knew what was coming‚Äîthey got out before the rest of the market caught on. The result? A crash that rocked the global economy.

# 2024: The Echo of 2007

Fast forward to 2024, and here we are again. The 2-Year Treasury yield is back at those same levels. The Fed‚Äôs been hiking rates, trying to keep inflation under control. But this time, the threats are broader‚Äîgeopolitical tensions, a shaky global economy, and inflation that just won‚Äôt quit. The yield sitting where it is now feels like d√©j√† vu.

# What Comes Next: Stay Sharp

So what‚Äôs the play? If you‚Äôve been around the block, you know that the drop in the 2-Year yield back in 2007 wasn‚Äôt just a blip‚Äîit was the start of something bigger. And with the yield at similar levels now, it‚Äôs a signal that things could turn south fast.

This is where you separate the pros from the amateurs. Don‚Äôt get caught flat-footed. Diversify, manage your risks, and keep an eye on the bigger picture. The market‚Äôs whispering a warning, and if you‚Äôre smart, you‚Äôll listen.

At the end of the day, the 2-Year Treasury yield isn‚Äôt just another number. It‚Äôs a gauge of what‚Äôs coming. And if history‚Äôs about to repeat itself, you better be ready to make your move."

Iran-Israel war is devastating for Indian Stock Market ,75,1c61tkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1c61tkr/iranisrael_war_is_devastating_for_indian_stock/,1713331320.0,32,"Israel is still contemplating on how should it respond to Iranian drone attacks. The IDF chief has confirmed that there will certainly be an attack. So while we wait, I thought of adding my views on what does this war mean from an Indian market perspective.

1. There is a limited impact on imports and exports from the these two countries for India. Two points there:

- India has a net positive trade relationship with Israel. We export more to them than import from them. Our imports are more in the diamond, pearls, spacecraft parts and chemicals space. This is worth only $2B imports annually.

- India has a net positive trade with Iran too. Also due to US sanctions, India does not import any Iranian oil.

2. However, there will be massive impact on broader trade for India - Think Oil! The reason for that lies in The Strait of Hormuz.

3. This strait is the world's busiest oil-shipping channel. It accounts for 20% of all oil trade and 33% of all LNG trade. At its narrowest, the strait passes entirely through the territorial waters of Iran.

4.. Oil tankers from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq have to pass through this strait. The world's largest crude oil port - Ras Tanura of Saudi Arabia - is in this strait.

5.. As per UN convention, this strait is part of international waters and cannot be blocked by Iran. However, the Iranian army still attacked the India-bound Israeli vessel on April 14th.

6. This is the fear about disruption of oil supply. This fear is driving the speculations in the market. This in-turn will result in potential price hikes of crude oil. And that is what is dangerous for us.

7. India is net importer of oil and imports 80% of all their oil needs from outside. With Russia Ukraine war, we are able to meet 30% of our needs through cheap Russian oil. However, with the payment problems with Russia and Houthis attacks in Red sea, this is no longer an option. India has started relying on Iraqi oil and Saudi Arabian oil more - both in the strait of Hormuz.

8. With that, a peek on the industries that can potentially feel the heat of war.

1.       Oil marketing companies: IOCL, HPCL, BPCL. Any increase in price of oil will impact the earnings of Oil marketing companies in India. With the upcoming elections, they will not be able to pass this extra cost to the customers. However, the strong earnings (2 years) will help cushion any short term price hikes of upto $90 - $95 per barrel. Larger scale of operations and high degree of integration between refining and marketing will allow IOCL and BPCL to absorb shocks better than HPCL. In addition, there is a 30,000 crore crore in capital support as per budget that can cover for any cashflow losses.

2. Paints industry: Asian Paints, Shalimar paints, Berger paints, Indigo paints. Any time crude prices go up, the input costs of paint companies increases. Crude oil costs account for nearly 40% input costs.

3. Tyre Industry: MRF, CEAT, Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres. The tyre industry uses crude oil derivatives for manufacturing synthetic rubber. Rise in crude price will hit their input costs and margins.

4. FMCG: HUL, ITC. Rising crude oil prices increases the cost of logistics / input materials. This cost is passed to consumers which reduces consumption. Any further reduction in rural consumption will hit FMCG companies a lot. Rising Inflation will keep RBI worried.

5. Railways: RVNL, IRCON, Jupiter Wagons. War will slow down India's push towards creating the India - Middle east - Europe corridor. This corridor is expected to have railway connections too. However, this corridor also passes through strait of Hormuz.

Hope this gives you a nice birds eye view on why the conflict has scared the market. On a happier note, oil prices first crashed and then stabalized. It did not hit the $100 levels yet.

"I'm mostly a lurker on this sub reddit, and have noticed the increase in low effort posts recently, so I thought for a change I'd put something that might help new traders deepen their understanding of the mechanics of the market, below is a blog post I wrote a few years ago, feedback is appreciated",108,1cz2lhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1cz2lhr/im_mostly_a_lurker_on_this_sub_reddit_and_have/,1716495542.0,22,"*Why does price move?*



Surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly), most of the people who trade/invest in financial markets have a tendency to skip the basics of how the markets work, one of the most commonly ignored basic aspects is why the market moves in the first place.

Note that ""Why did price move up from this point"" is a very different question from ""Why did people decide to buy at this point"".

People can buy/sell for any number of reasons, but the interaction between the aggressive and passive participants is what leads to price discovery.

So, why does price move?

¬†***More buyers than sellers?***

Definitely not, every buy is a sell, for any trade to execute, the numbers of buyers and sellers must always be equal to each other, otherwise, there would be no trade.¬†

***Less supply than demand?***

This could sometimes be true in the case of stocks because the free float market capitalization amount for any company is a limited number, so it is possible that an actual shortage of shares issued by the company may lead to a price hike, but it's not something you see happen every day, and this thinking does not apply to derivatives such as futures and options, derivative contracts are mostly used for speculative purposes these days with very little intent of actually taking delivery of the underlying, thus the contracts are created and destroyed as and when needed, there is no scope of there ever being a¬† contract supply shortage since new contracts are created as trades are executed.

***More desperate buyers than desperate sellers?***

Possibly, when I say desperate buyers, I mean buyers who are willing to transact at a worse price (aka at the offer price) rather than placing a bid of their own, in simple terms, these are buyers placing buy market orders as opposed to placing buy limit orders. While this explanation is pretty close to the truth, it still shows only one side of the coin.

***Maybe a better question is, what stops price from moving in the first place?***

Imagine you're in an apartment building, and there is a ceiling above you, and a floor below you, now if you want to go to the floor above you, you will have to break through the ceiling right? (assuming stairs and elevators don't exist and you have a very solid jump)

And if you want to go to the floor below you, you'll have to break the floor underneath your feet, so as long as you don't break the ceiling or the floor, you are not going anywhere.

Now how quickly you are able to get out of your room is dependent on two things, how hard you can hit the ceiling/floor, and how thick the ceiling/floor happens to be.¬†

The floors and ceilings are analogies for bids (limit buy) and offer (limit sell) orders respectively, they are also called the liquidity in the market.

Thicker markets (like bond futures) will require a lot of hitting before the floor/ceiling breaks when compared to thinner markets (such as crude oil, single stock futures), as discussed in the last blog, we hit the floor/ceiling by placing market orders, and the market orders eat away the liquidity at a level until it is exhausted, at which point we move to the next level, this is called the liquidity consumption model.

Imagine after a lot of hitting, you finally break the ceiling and go to the floor above you, now before you do anything, answer this question:

***Is it easier to go up or down from here?***

On one hand, you can jump up and ram your head against the ceiling above you till it breaks and you can jump to the next floor, on the other, you can just jump back down to the previous floor through the hole you just created when you came up.

So, as long as the hole is not repaired, it will be way easier to come down rather than move up.



https://preview.redd.it/8ovjvzvdg82d1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e3a8da3f9b20afe6977fe6155941b67e202671

  




In the above order book, note that as you get closer to the current market price, the bids and offers get thinner, and as you move away from it, they get thicker.

The bids get smaller and smaller the higher you go, and when you look above the current market price, the number of bids drop to 0.

So, if let's say someone steps in and places a buy market order of 324 contracts, the first 92 will get executed at 17501 and the remaining 232 contracts will get executed at 17502, so we just broke 2 ceilings above our head to get to 17503.

Since there were no bids initially at 17500,17501, and 17502, it will create a liquidity vacuum (or a hole in the floor in our analogy) which will need to be repaired, the vacuum will automatically get repaired over time as buyers come in and start bidding at these levels, but for a short duration in time, there will be a moment where the offer side liquidity will be extremely thick compared to the bid side liquidity.¬†

¬†This is what the above will look like after the price jumps up a few floors

https://preview.redd.it/fmxxqobfg82d1.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ce0690e9d96c82aaef61c9dfba18285320d174d

  




Since the floors are weaker than the ceilings, it will be easier to drive the price down than driving up, so in case any trader decides to book his profits after the up move, it wouldn't take a lot from him to actually drive the prices down again, essentially this is what is called a pullback in the market.

More often than not, whenever there is a breakout in the market, the market has a tendency to instantly reverse and revisit the level before moving up again, allowing for a second entry in the breakout, that reverse and revisit is caused by the phenomenon I described above,

On a price chart, this is what it would look like:

https://preview.redd.it/u6o77tbng82d1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=23676da48d9a2e1fdc4a01734b717d8166069bde

Now does it mean every time the market moves up it will lead to push down? No

But does it make sense for it to do so? Yep, hence this is why markets tend to move in waves on all time frames, from the 1 second chart all the way to daily, weekly, monthly charts, this fractal nature of the market is what causes the ebbs and flows across time frames

SBFC Finance - MSME Lender,6,1gxrg9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1gxrg9y/sbfc_finance_msme_lender/,1732336303.0,1,"    I started reading up on this business by means of its most recent investment presentation for Q2FY25 and witnessed a few things, sharing them here.
    
    Any inputs, critical view of thought process, feedback, inputs appreciated. If someone has spent time reading through their annual reports, previous quarter presentations, calls and anything that is worth digging further to develop a better understanding of their business, please share.
    
    #### Business
    
    * 99% Secured book, despite that their GNPA is 2.69%. They seem to be lending to a really risky segment - but needs further digging.
    * Their return on assets is really strong at 4.56% but because they have high capital adequacy ratio (38.6% CRAR) their overall return on equity is in low double digits (12.67%)
    * The business is currently valued at over 3x the book value, but if they increase their gearing ratio (leverage) thereby reducing their adequacy ratio (CRAR), they might be able to scale up their return on equity and hence profitability. Remains to be seen what are their growth targets (and whether they are sustainable).
    
    #### Concerns
    
    * Asset quality given their book is 99% secured (GNPA 2.69%, NNPA 1.63%, Credit Cost: 0.95%)
    * Low provision coverage ratio 40.17%
    * Average ticket size is quite high, meaning a low number of customers can really spike the asset quality unless they scale this rapidly enough - basically high ticket size with high volumes such that small customers don‚Äôt have the ability to take away profits by being delinquent / delayed on their payments.
    * The yield of 17.64% on secured lending seems worrisome. Why can‚Äôt customers run away to more established lenders or at least small finance banks after a year or two‚Äôs consistent payment thereby showcasing their ability to pay?
    * Cost of funds is high as compared to a small finance bank - 9.33% - meaning they will be forced to lend at high rates, thereby either sticking to low quality in customers - but doing high ticket sizes (so higher chances of large delinquencies) or considerably bringing down their yield - hence profitability / return ratios.
    
    #### Earnings Call Q2FY25
    
    * In this environment the challenge isn't the bounce rates going up, but the challenge has been once the customer slips to bring the customer back has become that much extra difficult. The
    * The environment has become tighter and now in the current market environment usually what happens is that when unsecured lenders tighten the belts, the secured lenders do face some impact which naturally comes thereafter.
    * The difficulty to bring the customer back once slip, once he goes to 60 DPD then he keeps being stable, but we find it difficult to bring him back to normalcy which was a little easier earlier
    * Q: You also mentioned your cost of funding going up, which is fair, but incrementally are we able to really pass it on to customers because I think in the 1st Phase of the rate hike you are able to maintain your spreads very well. Do you see that incrementally while the cost is going up, it's a challenge to pass it on.
      * Response: We have a category of customers which range anything between 5 lakhs to 30-odd lakhs, and towards the higher end of the ticket sizes and for the higher end is 15 lakhs and above, we tend to co-originate those loans, which effectively means that only 20% of those loans are with us and 80% is with the co-originating partner‚Ä¶. if you look at even our current quarter you would see co-origination as a percentage is at 17%-odd and the balance is on the SBFC book so you would see a positive impact there‚Ä¶ largely the book is on a variable rate so our ability to pass on is extremely high on the book.
        * Concern: They are already yielding close to 18% on secured lending (property and gold). And they see further increase in rates due to the cost of funds going up - how sustainable is this? These are inching close to microfinance rates for secured lending.
        * This concern is further emphasised by management mentioning that it usually takes them 10-12 working days to finalise decision to lend whereas in unsecured the turnaround is quite rapid - within a few days
          * In fact, I will be very worried if someone wants me to say a yes or no in 24 hours. So, by default, probably my answer is going to be no. So, we really don't want to lend up in a hurry and then take a long time collecting it. So, in secured, there are multiple things that go in before we decision it. While a financial decision is relatively easy provided he has all the documents together, but that seldom happens for an average 10 lakh customer. The second part that the time taking part is the property details, which is respect to legal or title. So, thereabout, we would take close to around 10 working days to 12 working days to finally decision and hand out the money to the customer. So, unlike unsecured, secured does go through a bit of detailing before we hand out the money to the customer.
          * So, for a customer who is given money at very high rates, why would they stick around if they can get a loan from a small finance bank rather quickly at almost similar interest rates or maybe even lower as the small finance bank‚Äôs cost of funds would be much lower.
      * Aseem Dhru mentions this challenge:
        * Maintaining margins is going to be a key challenge and as bank‚Äôs NIMs come under pressure, NBFC NIMs will also come under pressure. Our ability to manage is what will get tested.
        * That [passing rate increases to customers] is of course an option available, we have a variable portfolio. But we also have to be cognizant of the fact that we deal with customers who are vulnerable to EMI increases. So, we don't want to do it as much as possible. We will do it if we have to. But as much as possible, we would rather find innovative ways to reduce our cost of fund.
        * We have diversified our holding away from banks, we have been continuously dropping our percentage borrowing from banks and we have gone to the NCD market which is giving us a better yield. We are now going to raise it from multilateral financial institutions shortly. So, we have to find ways to battle it.
    * Q: Customer segment
      * Response: it's not that there is a whole hoard of customers that have fallen in, it is just that the regular customers who used to bounce and pay, their ability to collect has declined to some extent, only within that cohort of customers. And when two EMIs pile up, it becomes a little difficult for the customer to pay 2 EMIs because, of course, see, the post-pandemic inflation has been quite substantial, and the incomes haven't really kept pace. So, it's very logical, and we are not dealing with the top-end of customers in the space, we are dealing with customers who are managing to keep their ends meet. So, there is a demand on their incomes, more than what their incomes are in line.
      * Also, small businesses have their own challenges. As India gets more organised, some of the small businesses find the competitive intensity quite a lot. And today, if you see corporate results, they show pain of growth. Now, obviously, that same growth is also affecting the small businesses. It's just that they don't come in newspapers, and there is no data readily available as to what impact they have.
      * So, nothing really dramatic. It is just that a slight slowdown in their income or a slight increase in their cost, they find it a little difficult to service, but these come back. These are cycles. They will be brought back. It will take some time, but they will all be brought back.
      * Since they do secured lending overall loss of money is quite low/insignificant, in secured assets, overall in the last three years, we have just written off around 10, 12 crores. So, it's immaterial to that extent. In unsecured portfolio, we would have done some write-offs, but that's a rundown portfolio, now only 55 crores is left. So, from an overall perspective, there has been hardly any write-offs.
    * Q: On increasing leverage
      * Response: Liabilities are more than plenty. I don't think there is any challenge of liabilities in the market. Also, if you see, while the MCLRs are going up and the cost of borrowing in the markets are going up, but we have been able to maintain our cost of borrowing. So, that also in a way says that since we have enough liquidity, our ability to negotiate and bargain a good price is there. So, I think there is no problem from a liquidity point of view.
      * your other question as to in terms of leverage, you are absolutely right. As we go along, the entire growth is going to be funded through debt till the time we achieve a respectable leverage. The reason you are seeing sometimes in a quarter-to-quarter basis is there is a profit which also kicks in, which adds to the net worth of the company. And that's the reason the leverage sometimes may look optically similar. But all the growth is getting funded through debt.
      * We are sitting on a lot more cash than we need to, just to ensure that we have a good night's sleep. So, we are sitting on excess liquidity. So, that also is a factor.
    * Q: RBI declined HFC application
      * Policy level decision, nothing against SBFC finance. RBI doesn‚Äôt want a regulated entity under another regulated entity.
    * Q: Several participants asked questions about business model / business fundamentals. Helpful to hear that to build understanding of the business.I started reading up on this business by means of its most recent investment presentation for Q2FY25 and witnessed a few things, sharing them here.

      * Response: it's not that there is a whole hoard of customers that have fallen in, it is just that the regular customers who used to bounce and pay, their ability to collect has declined to some extent, only within that cohort of customers. And when two EMIs pile up, it becomes a little difficult for the customer to pay 2 EMIs because, of course, see, the post-pandemic inflation has been quite substantial, and the incomes haven't really kept pace. So, it's very logical, and we are not dealing with the top-end of customers in the space, we are dealing with customers who are managing to keep their ends meet. So, there is a demand on their incomes, more than what their incomes are in line.
      * Also, small businesses have their own challenges. As India gets more organised, some of the small businesses find the competitive intensity quite a lot. And today, if you see corporate results, they show pain of growth. Now, obviously, that same growth is also affecting the small businesses. It's just that they don't come in newspapers, and there is no data readily available as to what impact they have.
      * So, nothing really dramatic. It is just that a slight slowdown in their income or a slight increase in their cost, they find it a little difficult to service, but these come back. These are cycles. They will be brought back. It will take some time, but they will all be brought back.
      * Since they do secured lending overall loss of money is quite low/insignificant, in secured assets, overall in the last three years, we have just written off around 10, 12 crores. So, it's immaterial to that extent. In unsecured portfolio, we would have done some write-offs, but that's a rundown portfolio, now only 55 crores is left. So, from an overall perspective, there has been hardly any write-offs.
    * Q: On increasing leverage
      * Response: Liabilities are more than plenty. I don't think there is any challenge of liabilities in the market. Also, if you see, while the MCLRs are going up and the cost of borrowing in the markets are going up, but we have been able to maintain our cost of borrowing. So, that also in a way says that since we have enough liquidity, our ability to negotiate and bargain a good price is there. So, I think there is no problem from a liquidity point of view.
      * your other question as to in terms of leverage, you are absolutely right. As we go along, the entire growth is going to be funded through debt till the time we achieve a respectable leverage. The reason you are seeing sometimes in a quarter-to-quarter basis is there is a profit which also kicks in, which adds to the net worth of the company. And that's the reason the leverage sometimes may look optically similar. But all the growth is getting funded through debt.
      * We are sitting on a lot more cash than we need to, just to ensure that we have a good night's sleep. So, we are sitting on excess liquidity. So, that also is a factor.
    * Q: RBI declined HFC application
      * Policy level decision, nothing against SBFC finance. RBI doesn‚Äôt want a regulated entity under another regulated entity.
    * Q: Several participants asked questions about business model / business fundamentals. Helpful to hear that to build understanding of the business."
Where the gainz at??,7,1ffxcr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ffxcr7/where_the_gainz_at/,1726240825.0,7,"I keep hearing about these 1.5\~2% per month is realistic and ""easy""

  
I tried studying reports, earnings, balance sheets, news, deep fundamental analysis, the market has a tendency to do the opposite of what logic would dictate

  
I see people recommending ""swing"" trading quite a lot on this forum, never seen any concrete info on it, 15-30 day ranges, prices will be heavily affected by news & fundamentals, idk how swing trading is working out for some people or is it just dumb luck?

  
Am I missing something here?

I have \~1Cr distributed across US stocks and Mutual funds in India, with recent salary hike, I have some extra cash lying around that I'd like to invest, but none of my bets seem to have worked out in the last few months, I've traded on and off for last 3 years or so (since then time I got a job).

  
I'm also trying to dip my feet a little bit into algo-paper trading, but that a different hell altogether, my code makes 100\~150% in a day, and loses it all in the same day, sometimes it racks up heavy charges

My mutual funds have grown at \~16% CAGR in the last 3 years, which isn't super impressive, but not bad either. Because I have some cash, I wanted to get better at investing and was looking for some pointers to get better at the game, my expectations aren't anything crazy, I'd be super happy if I can make 1\~2% a month on my own (without relying on my fund manager)

  
TLDR; suck at investing & trading, need advice, or should I just give up?"
Market Volatility & Strategy Thoughts,2,1g6d5gw,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1g6d5gw/market_volatility_strategy_thoughts/,1729239627.0,3,"This month has been quite volatile for the markets due to a range of reasons: war tensions in the Middle East, escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, crude price hikes, SEBI regulations, FII heavy selling, and now the below-expectation Q2 results from big companies.

From following the sub, it's clear that some people are running out of cash after buying the initial small dips, while others are stuck in the buy-high, sell-low strategy. Personally, I think many sectors, especially PSUs, will remain sideways for a while. I also feel that the ""finfluencer"" recommended stocks could end up trapping a lot of investors. These stocks have become overvalued and are in nearly everyone's portfolio who follows these influencers blindly without much research.(some rare eg- PSUs, Zomato, Trent, KPIT, Kalyan, Anand Rathi)

At this point, I believe staying away from the market might be the best strategy. We haven't seen a severe impact yet from these global events, but I have a gut feeling that it‚Äôs coming‚Äîand it might not be too far off, especially with the U.S. elections just around the corner.

I've been analyzing a few stocks that are available at good valuations, but honestly, I feel a bit greedy. I expect the markets to go down further, so I'm tempted to wait for even better prices.

What are your thoughts? Are you buying at current levels? Why or why not? What levels are you considering to re-enter the market, and what‚Äôs your thesis behind it?

Also, when do you think this FII selling will stop? In my view, FIIs are selling off for a few key reasons:

1. Overvaluation in certain sectors that are still showing momentum (e.g., PSUs hitting all-time highs) while fundamentally strong sectors like FMCG, Pharma, and private banks haven‚Äôt moved much in this bull run.
2. Increasing retail participation might be leading FIIs to expect more volatility.
3. Stock prices seem to be running ahead of actual growth.

Would love to hear your takes on this!"
Why's your pf down and what can be done for a good sustainable growth !,3,1fkivq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fkivq3/whys_your_pf_down_and_what_can_be_done_for_a_good/,1726746622.0,6,"This year many psu's and defence stocks rallied a lot, many newbies also made money from them and thought of themselves as a good investor 

After hype backed by finfluencers, ministers and media generated enough liquidity big players exited , but they didn't exit at once they keep on pumping it some days so that retailers will thought it's back on track just to get stuck !Specially defence stocks 

I see many retailers just waiting to enter their fav defence stocks , A large number of retailers have fallen in love with them like if they want to make money they want to make from them , let it go 
Never attach yourself to a share 

Also many of the defence stocks were way overvalued,people gave the rational defence is the future without even going deep to find out company capability to execute order , for ex :- hal is facing delay in executing orders from many months 

So where to invest ? Invest in companies which will start getting good orders now which are likely to increase later 

Some companies have done a good Capex for future endeavors which will turns out to be a gold mine look for those too 

Power transmission is a great sector too , we are generating power but in areas away from major cities so transmission will see a great growth 

I am not taking the name of the stocks but there are some shares which have like a great support they are either sustaining Well( even during Japan hike) or are able to recover their fall in few days 

Herd mentality is the reason retailers are called dumb money , do proper research and believe !

One of the reasons for the fall in global markets.,18,1ekw11n,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1ekw11n/one_of_the_reasons_for_the_fall_in_global_markets/,1722884442.0,9,"Why are global markets falling, including India's?

It's mainly due to the 'Yen Carry Trade.'

1. Investors borrowed cheap yen from Japan to invest in higher return assets globally. 
2. Bank of Japan hiked rates by 0.25% last week.
3. The Fed signaled future rate cuts.

Result? The yen is rising against the USD and other currencies and sell off in risky assets.

Let's understand it with an example.

Before Interest Rate Hike:
1. An investor borrows 1,000,000 yen at 0.1% interest from Japan.
2. Converts the 1,000,000 yen to USD at an exchange rate of 1 USD = 100 yen, getting $10,000.
3. Invests $10,000 in a global asset with a 5% return, earning $500.

After Interest Rate Hike and Yen Appreciation:
1. Bank of Japan raises interest rates to 0.25%.
2. The yen appreciates to 1 USD = 90 yen.
3. The investor needs to repay 1,000,000 yen + 0.25% interest = 1,002,500 yen.
4. Converts $10,000 + $500 (returns) = $10,500 back to yen at the new rate, getting 945,000 yen.
5. The investor now has a shortfall of 57,500 yen due to the stronger yen and higher interest rate.

This increased cost forces investors to sell off their global investments to repay their yen loans, causing markets to fall."
Deep Value Investment ,10,1fdjdys,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1fdjdys/deep_value_investment/,1725978935.0,5,"Elnet Technologies 

Consistent Operating History with diversified clientele: Incorporated in 1990, ETL is one of the first IT Parks developed in Chennai on a land measuring 3.16 acres. The land was handed over for development of IT Park through a government order in 1991 and the commercial operations begun in 1996. The IT Park has a leasable space of 2.30 lac sqft and has been leased out to multiple small and mid-sized players. The IT Park has a stable track record of operations, and the overall occupancy level of the property continues to remain strong at 90% as on September 30, 2023. Elnet averaged 13.7% return on equity and 37.2% return on capital employed from 2015 through 2024. The client base is mostly small and mid-sized players with majority of them being backend service and support providers in IT/ITES to various industries. Average floor area of the IT Park ranges from 3,500 sq. ft. to 10,000 sq. ft. Major tenants include Sterling Software, Quintessence Business Solutions and Services Pvt Ltd, Crayon Data India Pvt Ltd, Karur Vysya Bank, Information Dynamics India, etc. 

Favourable Location and Long-Term Prospects of IT Park: The IT Park is located in the region encompassing Taramani and Thiruvanmiyur on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) which is known as the IT hub of Chennai. The region has emerged as a preferred office destination by the IT/ITES sector, concentrated by top global players in the industry. Its proximity to the city centre, easy access to the airport, availability of good quality office buildings, good connectivity by roads & rail (MRTS), developed social infrastructure and presence of key residential areas in its vicinity are key demand contributors to attract major IT/ITES occupiers.

Elnet Gross Income increased by 1.5x to INR 34 crores whereas it‚Äôs profit increased 3x to INR 17.5 crores from 2015 through 2024. The possibility of Elnet failing in the long term is abysmal. In the last 3 decade they were able to ride the wave of IT revolution. However in the future if there is another revolution still they will be leasing there offices to other industries like Renewable sector and Startup ecosystem. They have advantage that they only cater to small and mid-sized players, and when the small companies turn big they move to bigger areas, and if they don‚Äôt still they need small offices to operate. Contrary to other IT Park which is in the proximity to larger ones like Ramanujam IT City (45 lac sqft) and Tidel Park (12.8 lac sqft), which offer wider floor plates and premium facilities/amenities have a huge chances of un-occupancy in the recession and tough times as MNC‚Äôs cut costs and layoff their employees. Elnet is partly mitigated by prime location of the asset, competitive rate, long-term stickiness of clients, and steady occupancy levels. Additionally, the concentration risk is low due to diverse tenants occupying the premises and no particular tenant is occupying more than 15% of the total leasable area. Also, Elnet has no plans to expand or built new infrastructure. Capital reinvestment and working capital needs are minor and working capital investments are nonexistent. Thus Elnet produces above average returns on capital and generate substantial cash in excess of their operating needs.  

Healthy occupancy levels: The occupancy level of the asset continues to remain strong at 90% as on September 30, 2023, as corporates continued to remain committed towards work from office/hybrid model over work from home. In the past three fiscals, the occupancy level stood strong over 85%. Considering strong occupancy level, the company continues to enjoy consistent revenue stream with Total Operating Income of INR 26 crore and profit margin of 51%. The lease agreements are generally for a period of 3-5 years with a lock-in period of 1-5 years with in-built escalation clause of lease rent hike of 5% every year. 


Profit Margin has doubled to 51% in 2024 from 24% in 2015, contribution from interest income from the deposits partly offset by the low cost structure of the company. As of FY24, the company has on its Roll fourteen employees (excluding Managing Director) and the rest of the operations are carried through outsourcing.  


Comfortable capital structure: The Company has not availed any long-term loans or working capital facility. As on March 31, 2024, the total debt outstanding is ‚Çπ4.26 crore in the form of unsecured loans availed from the group entity, ‚ÄòStur Technologies‚Äô. Currently, there are no plans to avail additional debt and hence financial risk profile of the company is expected to remain comfortable. While there are no expansion plans in consideration, the company may undertake new projects in medium term, and hence, its impact on the capital structure remains monitorable.


Liquidity: The liquidity profile of the ETL is adequate with sufficient cash accruals as against no longterm repayment obligations. The company holds cash and cash equivalent of close to INR 111.5 crore, mainly in the form of bank fixed deposits as of March 2024. The company does not have any debt, with the working capital requirements being met by internal accruals without any debt. 


Value: From 2013 to 2024, Elnet Technologies earned INR 115 crore for its owners. From these earnings company paid shareholders INR 7.67 crore in dividend and retained 107 crore. In April 2013, the total market value of the company was INR 14 crore. As of now market value had grown to 148 crore. Over the 12 year period, for every INR 100 the company retained, it created INR 125 in market value for shareholders. 


As of 5th September, the total market value for the Elnet technologies is INR 148 crore. We will start by calculating the Free Cash flow i.e PAT (17.49) plus Non-cash charges plus D&A minus capital expenditures minus other income (8.27) yielding FCF of INR 9.22 crore. (Assumption: In the long term D&A and Capital Expenditure will remain same). If we divide FCF by long term India government bond yield (7%) plus 2% premium, the value of future cash flow is INR 102.4 crore. Adding the present value of 102.4 crore with the cash lying on the Balance sheet of 111.5 crore gives the value of INR 214 crore i.e upside of 44% from current market value of 148 crore.  

214 crore value is the most conservative, as the discount rate used here is 9% including 2% premium. Warren Buffet dismisses the concept of equity risk premium because it is an artifact of the capital asset pricing model that uses price volatility as a measure of risk. In simple terms higher the price volatility, the higher the equity risk premium. Buffet thinks the whole idea that price volatility is a measure of risk is nonsense. In his mind, business risk is reduced by focusing on companies with consistent and predictable earnings.  

Given that Elnet technologies have consistent and predictable earnings, using the discount rate of long term India government bond yield (7%) will give valuation of INR 246 crore. And If we take one more assumption, that the company can grow its FCF (9.22) by 2%, this will give the value of INR 300 crore which is double from the current market value. Further value can be unlocked through an increase in dividend though this is at the discretion of the management. 

Key weaknesses: 

Renewal risk of lease contracts: ETL has entered into lease agreements with various tenants, with most of them ranging for a term period of 3‚Äì5 years with the lock-in period of 1-5 years. Post this the tenants have an option to terminate the lease agreement by giving 6 months‚Äô notice without any charges. In next 12 months, lease contracts for more than 25% of occupied area are due for renewal. Hence, company is exposed to the renewal risk for these contracts. However, demonstrated track record of renewals in the past mitigates the risk to a large extent. According to the CARE Ratings, majority of the tenants have carried out their own fitouts which enhances the tenant stickiness.  

Counterparty risk: The Company is exposed to the counterparty risk as majority of the tenants are small and mid-sized IT/ITES players providing back-end support services to various industries. However, comfort is drawn from the fact that the company undertakes necessary due diligence of each tenant before entering into a lease agreement and securing 10 months rental as security deposit (in respect of majority of the tenants). As on March 31, 2024, ETL holds cancellable and non-cancellable deposits related to lease rentals to the tune of INR 13 crore. The total rental receivables from the tenants stood low at ‚Çπ2.52 crore.

Good news on 2 fronts, important for the big stockmarket cashflows and with impact on all your investments

**A.** No need for Bank of Japan rate hike in September

https://preview.redd.it/jv0z414fo8od1.jpg?width=790&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bc93fc464b1dc6b6ceecaf626e68abeffd1c4d4

And with significant lower oil price, high LNG inventories in Japan and a YEN becoming more expensive compared to the USD, I expect that BoJ will not have to raise their rate in coming months, making it a less aggressive rate hike cycle.

Next BoJ rate hike in January 2025 maybe.

**B.** A softer Basel III End game: less capital requirements for banks

The higher the capital requirements for banks, the more they will have to increase their capital or the more they will have to reduce their exposure to assets (loans, stocks, ...)

**Industry overview**  
  
  
The Global PV sales in CY2023 was dominated by Toyota Group at 11.1 million, followed by Volkswagen Group with 9.2 million units and Hyundai Motor Group (Hyundai + Kia) with 7.3 million units, with **Hyundai group being 3rd largest global passenger vehicle ( PV) maker.**  
  
**According to CRISIL MI&A, India had 26 cars per 1,000 people as of Fiscal 2024.** Although the penetration grew from 22 cars per 1000 people in Fiscals 2019 to 26 cars as of Fiscal 2024, it is significantly lower than the developed nations and even emerging nations like Brazil, Russia, and Mexico. This provides significant headroom for growth, especially given the expected increase in disposable incomes, faster economic growth, younger population, and increased focus from international OEMs.  
  
As per CRISIL MI&A, Indian economy is expected to surpass US$5 trillion mark over the next seven fiscals (2025- 2031) and inching closer to US$7 trillion. A projected average GDP growth of 6.7% in this period will make India the third-largest economy in the world and lift per capita income to the upper middle-income category. **By Fiscal 2031, India‚Äôs per capita income will rise to approximately US$4,500, thereby making it an upper middle-income nation.**  
  
Between FY19 and FY24 , India‚Äôs domestic PV sales volume rose at 5% CAGR. This growth was despite the sales contraction (at 10% CAGR) witnessed during Fiscals 2019 to 2021. Sales were 3.9 million vehicles in Fiscal 2023. **CRISIL MI&A expects the industry to clock 4.5-6.5% CAGR between FY24 to FY29 period to reach 5.2-5.7 million domestic vehicle sales.**  
  
**Premiumization trend in Cars**

B/w FY21 and FY23 , car industry by value increased by 36% due to- premiumization- preference of SUVs- increase in prices due to emission norms-raw material price hike

**ASP( Avg selling price) rose from 491000rs to 659000rs b/w FY19 and FY23.**  
  
**Segment share of SUVs rose from 23% to 50% in FY24 at 23% CAGR.** Recognizing the changing consumer preferences, OEMs also launched higher number of vehicles in the SUV segment. The mid-size SUV segment (24% CAGR) outpaced the entire SUV segment. Continued traction for the high selling models like Hyundai Creta & Kia Seltos as well as Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Urban cruiser Hyryder, and Honda Elevate provided the thrust to the growth of mid-size SUVs. **The share of small cars (hatchbacks) reduced from 46.9% in Fiscal 2019 to 34.4% in Fiscal 2023.**  
  
The hatchbacks segment lost market share owing to  
- lack of new model launches  
-frequent hikes in vehicle prices  
-increase in operating costs amid fuel price hikes  
-an unfavourable macroeconomic environment that impacted the price sensitive entry-level customer base  
  
  
Domestic PV industry is an oligopolistic market with few players dominating the entire industry. Maruti Suzuki is the market leader ,Hyundai Motor India second largest contributor to the domestic sales, followed by Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra. These 4 players together contribute approximately 80% of the market.

**Operating metrics**  
  
Hyundai has sold following number of cars in FY24-  
ICE 506,250  
CNG 60,320  
EV 975  
  
Hyundai has lost some share in the hatchbacks segment in the last 5 years. Discontinuation of its compact hatchbacks Santro and Eon impacted the company‚Äôs share within the hatchbacks segment. Intensified competition with entry of new models Tata Altroz and Toyota Glanza in the premium hatchbacks segment exerted pressure on its share in the premium hatchbacks sub-segment in the last 5 years.  
  
In the compact sedans segment, Maruti Suzuki leads with a market share of approximately 58.5%, from the Dzire model. **Following Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai holds a share of around 19.8%, attributed to Aura model.** **In the premium sedans segment, Hyundai Motor India dominates with a 31.2% market share**, driven by sale of its only model Verna.  
  
Compared to other segments, the SUV segment is much more fragmented with no clear leader and very close competition between the OEMs. Hyundai dominates the mid-size SUV sub segment. **With its flagship model Creta, Hyundai commanded a leading 30% market share.**  
  
**Hyundai has more than 1,350 sales touchpoints across India.** Maruti Suzuki has about 3,250 touchpoints in India. **Hyundai has 1500 service touchpoints**, while Maruti has 4,560 service touchpoints. In terms of sales+ service touchpoints, Hyundai is 2nd largest after Maruti.  
  
Maruti leads the industry with PV market share of 41.3%. Hyundai used to be undisputed 2nd player for long, **but currently at 14.6% market share** where Tata Motors is breathing at its shoulders with 14% market share.  
Operating margins are higher for Mahindra at 12.3% due to being an only SUV player.

Provisions 1250cr.  
  
Net cashflow from operations 8700cr.





**Points to consider**  


Entire Auto industry is standing at crossroads to move on towards renewable energy like EV, CNG, Hybrid- so lot of technological change related investments has to be made by all players in coming few years. It is not clear which technology will emerge as winner, so incumbents must invest in all of them.  
  
**Top 5 suppliers constitute 44% of materials and top 10 suppliers constitute 59% of materials.17% of parts are sourced from Korea.**

**Hyundai has to pay 3.5% of revenues as royalty cost to HMC for R&D and manufacturing technology transfer.**  
  
Related party transactions in expenses side is 32% and 9% on the sales side.  
  
**HMC holds 34.16% stake in Kia Corporation** which operates in the automobile industry in India through its subsidiary, Kia India Private Limited. HMC‚Äôs chairman is also the chairman of Kia. HMI also supplies engines to Kia for their vehicles. Given the potential product overlaps between HMI's offerings and those of Kia in India, there is no assurance that conflicts of interest won't happen in future.  
  
12% of sales come from Middle East/Europe , 7% of sales come from Latin America, 4% from Africa, **so dependence on Exports is there for 23% of revenues.**  
  
**Capacity utilization in 9M FY24 is 97% , so until Talegaon plant comes up ( H2 FY26), there is capacity constraints for Hyundai**.  
  
They depend on subsidiary Mobis India for spare parts supplies."

Is the Indian Government Using Capital Gains Tax to Influence the Stock Market?,12,1eh15dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1eh15dp/is_the_indian_government_using_capital_gains_tax/,1722466767.0,3,"In the recent Indian budget announcement, a significant point of discussion has been the hike in capital gains tax to 20%. This increase has sparked debates and speculation about the government's intentions behind this move. Some analysts and investors wonder whether this is a deliberate strategy to influence the stock market's trajectory. Let's delve into this intriguing question.

The Capital Gains Tax Hike: A Quick Overview

Capital gains tax is levied on the profit realized from the sale of assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate. In India, the government recently raised the short-term capital gains (STCG) tax rate from 15% to 20% and lowered the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax rate from 20% to 12.5%, up from previous levels. This hike in STCG is substantial and affects a wide range of investors, from individuals to large institutional players.

The Possible Impact on the Stock Market

1. Reduced Selling Pressure: A higher capital gains tax can discourage investors from selling their assets too quickly, as the tax eats into their profits. By holding onto their investments longer, they avoid paying the higher tax rate, potentially leading to less selling pressure in the market. This could help maintain or even drive up stock prices, as fewer shares are being sold off.

2. Encouraging Long-Term Investment: The government's move could be interpreted as a nudge towards long-term investment. By making it more costly to realize short-term gains, the policy incentivizes investors to think long-term, which could lead to more stable and sustained market growth.

3. Revenue Generation vs. Market Stability: While the primary aim of a tax hike is usually to increase government revenue, it's worth considering whether there could be a secondary objective. The Indian government, like others, might benefit from showcasing a thriving stock market as a sign of economic strength. A rising market not only boosts investor confidence but also reflects well on the government‚Äôs economic management. 

Is There a Hidden Agenda?

The idea that the government might be using tax policy as a tool to influence the stock market is speculative but not entirely unfounded. Governments often use fiscal policies to achieve broader economic goals. By implementing a higher capital gains tax, the Indian government could be subtly encouraging market stability and growth, which in turn makes the economy look robust to both domestic and international observers.

However, it's crucial to consider the broader economic context. The Indian economy, like many others, is navigating a complex post-pandemic recovery landscape. The government may be looking to ensure a steady flow of revenue while also maintaining investor confidence in the market. A buoyant stock market can help in raising capital, encouraging investment, and stimulating economic activity.

Conclusion

While it‚Äôs impossible to say definitively whether the Indian government is using the capital gains tax hike as a tool to control the stock market, the implications are worth considering. The policy could indeed contribute to reduced volatility and encourage a more stable investment environment. Whether by design or as a beneficial side effect, this move aligns with the broader goal of fostering long-term economic growth.

Investors should keep an eye on how these policies evolve and continue to assess their impact on both their portfolios and the market as a whole. As with any fiscal policy, the full effects will only become apparent over time, and it will be interesting to see how this unfolds in the Indian economic landscape"

Hello everyone, I know that people are not happy with new charges and tax hike. 

First of all, let me clear some fiction statements.

I see lot of people abusing India which shows you are retard and should point government for such actions
Secondly people are saving ki me vote nahi duga modi ko and thinking they will lose future election. My friend only 3% of whole population invest in market and trade actively. In that also 60% of people have captial less then 20K. Even if you are angry and thinking about abusing modi government will not going to impact election. Major population which consist of farmer and poor middle class are happy and we as traders and active swing trader will going to suffer. Think before you speak as everyone will going to forget this day in coming year and we will be back to normal just like usual days. Start actively investing in foreign assets and even you can do this from your side or take help of other finance apps. 

I am not in favour of new tax regime as fno and swing trader. But crying will not going to make a change. Instead let us all work together and beat this shitty tax by making more profit. I rest my case"

Moreover, the Indian Railways has formulated a National Rail Plan for the year 2030. BEL has engaged in collaborative efforts with DMRC, RDSO, NCRTC, and a multitude of public and private entities, focusing on i-ATS System, Mission Critical Communication System, Composite Panel, Platform Screen Doors, and other related areas, Anand Rathi said in a note.

The brokerage suggested that Bharat Electronics has a strong balance sheet. It has been focusing on cost control and indigenization to improve the profitability. ""Financial profile remains strong because of healthy profitability and return indicators, zero debt, superior liquidity and strong debt coverage metrics.‚Äù

1) Moving towards self-reliance in defence

2) Robust pipeline and focus of exports by GOI 

3) Strong order inflow to drive the revenue growth

4) Healthy profitability and return indicators

&#x200B;

In the fiscal year 2023-24, BEL successfully secured orders worth around Rs 35,000 crore. The total order book of BEL as on April 1, 2024, stands at around Rs 76,000 crore. BEL has also achieved export sales of around $92.98 million during FY24, as against the previous year‚Äôs export turnover of $48.33 million, registering a growth of 92 percent. As on April 1, 2024 BEL's export order book stands at $407 million, with export orders acquired during the fiscal year amounting to $211 million.

The BEL order book is full till 2027-28, which will take care of the company's fundamentals.

Good for short term and long term.

Brokerage firm Jefferies has maintained its 'BUY' rating on BEL and has also hiked its target price to Rs 260 from earlier Rs 225.

* Jefferies' report highlights a huge domestic defense opportunity of $100-120 billion over the next 5-6 years, with a visible 13 per cent industry compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from FY23 to FY30.
* The export defense opportunity is expected to grow at a 21 per cent CAGR during the same period.
* According to the report, BEL is a steady play on overall defence spend.

Target: Rs 240, 260, 350

Holding duration: 3 to 12 months

Buying price: Rs 200 to 210

This year SBI probably will earn a profit of 1 lakh crore and there might be rate cuts in the upcoming quarters. Considering all this there is a good upside of 50% from CMP.

Is it wise to accumulate at the current price or should I wait for some quarters as NPA might increase in the upcoming quarters?
Although everyone is discounting rate cuts this year but Fed in its recent minutes said it might consider rate hikes if required and hence RBI will also maintain its rate.

So this is my theory !!


Russia has stopped supplying supplying gas and power to almost 40% of European nations.

Ofc, winter is coming - European countries will have a scarcity of gas and power for heating purpose. This will lead to inflation which will lead to price hike.

It's better that they have a vacation in Asian countries so that they save money instead of paying extra for gas and power. So i believe that ITC, IND Hotels, Lemon tree, etc will have good growth in the coming days.


Just an casual retail trader thoughts. Please do your research before you invest.

Gold loans: A new world order?,24,xtl613,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/xtl613/gold_loans_a_new_world_order/,1664705565.0,9,"*Muthoot and Manappuram are two of the largest gold loan NBFCs in India, with 2/3rds of the NBFC gold loan market covered between them. Both businesses are highly profitable,¬†with ROAs as high as SBI's credit card business.* 

*If you are¬†a long-term shareholder in¬†these companies, you'd have been¬†happy with the returns up until last year - Muthoot and Manappuram shares delivered 215% and 65% respectively from 2017¬†through 2021.¬†But things haven't been good in the past year - both company's shares have dropped between 30-40%, YoY profits shrank as per the latest results,¬†and¬†AUMs have flattened over the last 3¬†quarters.*

*What changed recently? Interestingly, Covid, banks, teasers and the RBI all have a role to play in the answer to that question.*

*With that context - let's jump right in and unpack what's going on!*

**Muthoot & Manappuram - then and now**

**Business overview**

Both Muthoot and Manappuram are NBFCs focused on gold loans, largely catering to underserved rural and semi-urban markets in India. While both entities have been diversifying into other lending segments, gold loans still constitute a significant portion of their AUM and profits. Also, both companies originated in the southern part of India (Kerala), but have been working on building¬†a pan-India¬†presence.

Together these two entities¬†control¬†2/3rds of the NBFC gold market - here are some stats on them. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3ybza6lu9dr91.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=a25e5848f1b4f1485ad40574d0bfed25f7a1af76

As a next step, let's look at the economics of the gold lending business. Given the underserved focus,¬†these businesses have strong pricing power (translating into high yields & high NIMs) and near-zero loss rates due to the secured nature of the loan.

Note that¬†per RBI guidelines, gold loans are capped at 75% Loan to Value (LTV). This makes gold loans extremely low risk for two reasons:  
1. Liquid Collateral: If you don't pay back,¬†the lender can easily liquidate your jewelry¬†to recover the loan amount. This¬†is unlike a home loan (another secured loan), where selling a house is a longer & tougher process for the lender  
2. Protection against volatility: We know that gold is a volatile commodity, but¬†note that the lender has a 25% buffer (via the 75% LTV). Since gold loans are typically short-term¬†loans, it's even lower risk given it's fairly unlikely for gold prices to drop by >25% in¬†short time periods

Let's look at some numbers for Muthoot and Manappuram. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2u3ye7gx9dr91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=5482e8434a21799b3b69deae0636bba9878d1a9e

 25+%¬†ROEs are a rare phenomena!

Based on the data above, both businesses appear to have very attractive economics. But that seems to have changed in the last¬†year. 

**Recent performance**

Both companies have lost between 30-40% of their market cap in the last¬†year. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wqsynyey9dr91.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf3fcb8221cd632ead7b10f011fb8fec61b9393

This isn't surprising if you look at some of the key performance drivers 

https://preview.redd.it/j04d1lcz9dr91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fc15ce1f1f2064689ecaa67ef6e419a8f49a94e

https://preview.redd.it/8q7yeg70adr91.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8b9c0f67c6f03dfcb28596f31d32a50a9bc1b2e

Clearly, something's going on - let's understand what in the next sections.

**Gold loans during¬†Covid**

**What worked for NBFCs**

First -¬†gold prices went up, a phenomenon¬†common during recessions given gold's status as a recessionary hedge. 

https://preview.redd.it/kjk9lkb1adr91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=286e0f6ea9bd8919fe1f0d36468de174832c8f28

Second -¬†demand for loans went up during Covid, and more¬†households in India pledged their gold to take loans - thereby increasing the demand for gold loans. As a result, both Manappuram and Muthoot did really well. Here are some stats to demonstrate this: 

https://preview.redd.it/qbyvrdb2adr91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69c6a0dc00558c711edc97b4cad5437638b3704

**What didn't work¬†for NBFCs**

But something else happened too - the RBI hiked **LTV caps from 75% to 90%**. This was a temporary measure to increase liquidity in the system,¬†which made logical sense at the time.

As a result, banks really doubled down on the gold loans segment during FY21. 

https://preview.redd.it/6xcid074adr91.png?width=517&format=png&auto=webp&s=318ca5191bb197e0a6efea9912edfabc37ec3b92

**COVID aftermath - competition!**

The 75-90% LTV hike nudged¬†a lot of banks to grow their gold lending businesses. With banks entering this segment, the gold lending space became very competitive.

Note that FY21 had¬†enough gold demand to absorb the credit supply from the new banking players entering the space - but as gold prices and loan demand tapered off in FY22, NBFCs struggled to compete with banks.

Here is a very powerful chart summarizing¬†exactly what¬†happened.¬† 

https://preview.redd.it/cizkwjs6adr91.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=57023f90a80e98558ade33af934ea67f0a212287

Yields (average loan interest rates)¬†for both businesses dropped drastically in FY22. This happened because both companies gave out teaser rates (as low as 6.9% per annum) to attract customers. 

And that was the only way Manappuram and Muthoot could compete with banks - given banks were charging between 7-12%,¬†which they could afford¬†given their low cost of funds! 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tvpo0gw7adr91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=61165da798cec20cd2206d9790a79b8b47e980ef

Clearly, it's impossible for these two NBFCs to compete with banks on interest rates. But the management of both companies seem to think that the bank competition is a¬†temporary phenomenon (driven by the LTV hike during Covid)¬†that will taper off going forward.

Well,¬†we're not entirely¬†convinced -¬†given the way some banks are growing their gold portfolios: 

https://preview.redd.it/5xwqjy0aadr91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=a349e0b49af1b4df136ebb6295ceff9e66141ac3

Based on the gold loan AUM numbers of¬†banks¬†over the last few quarters, it doesn't seem to us like banks are going to slow down. They might be here to stay! 

*With banks making headway in the gold loan space, do you think gold loan NBFCs are going to continue to struggle to grow & compete?*

Pre Market 19th April 2023,10,12re1ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/12re1ex/pre_market_19th_april_2023/,1681872270.0,2," 

Good day, fellow traders! Today's pre-market highlights the latest market updates from the American and Asian markets, as well as the trade setup for the day.

Starting off with the American market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a slight decline of 10.55 points, while the S&P 500 gained 3.55 points, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.31 points. The market is now keeping a close eye on earnings reports, which will determine whether the market will experience an upside or downside. The S&P 500 is trading near two-month highs, and investors are assessing the interest rate path ahead of an expected 25 basis point increase at the Federal Reserve's meeting early next month.

St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard suggests that the U.S. central bank should continue raising rates due to persistent inflation, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic believes that the Fed most likely has one more rate hike ahead. Moving on to the Asian markets, markets have opened mixed this morning as Fed officials appear divided on the quantum of future rate hikes. The Nikkei 225 index and the Topix are trading with minor losses, while the Kospi is up 0.25 percent.

The ASX 200 is trading 0.1 percent higher. Unfortunately, our Singapore Nifty futures have declined 35 points or 0.2 percent to 17,686.5, thereby pointing to a slightly negative opening for the market.

Looking at yesterday's trade and the option chain data for today's weekly options expiry, the trade setup for the day appears mixed. The Nifty 50 index opened slightly in the green yesterday but saw consolidation throughout the day, ending 47 points down. The technical chart suggests that the Nifty may find support at 17,650, followed by 17,580 and 17,440. On the upside, 17,750 is the initial key resistance level to watch out for, followed by 17,830 and 17,950.

Looking at the option chain data for tomorrow's weekly options expiry, the 17,700 strike call of the Nifty 50 index added 42.2 lakh shares in Open Interest, followed by the 17,900 call, which added 30.57 lakh shares. Open Interest addition was also seen in the 17,800 call (27.8 lakh shares), 17,750 call (24.7 lakh shares), and 17,650 call (23.2 lakh shares). On the downside, the 17,400 put added nearly 19.5 lakh shares in Open Interest, followed by the 17,650 put, which added 17.7 lakh shares.

As for the FII and DII activities, FIIs were net sellers of Rs. 811 crore, while DIIs were net buyers of Rs. 402 crore. Moving on to the Bank Nifty, it closed with marginal gains and formed a bearish candlestick pattern. However, it traded within the range of the previous session. As long as the index sustains above 42,000, it will remain in a buy-on-dip mode, and breaching this level may lead to a further correction towards the 41,500 level. The Bank Nifty may find support at 41,900, followed by 41,800 and 41,600, while key resistance levels are expected to be 42,550, along with 42,700 and 43,000.

Looking at the option chain data, the highest call writing is seen on 42,500 with 52.16 lakh shares, 43,000 with 41.77 lakh shares, and 43,500 with 35.64 lakh shares. On the"
Impatience,19,xzdld9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/xzdld9/impatience/,1665293625.0,8,"I started investing in stock market in Jan 2021. So, I missed the first low caused by first Covid lockdowns. I had to learn from scratch. No one in my family or friends invest in market. 

My first share was Tata Power and Yes Bank. Tata Power is till with me. Yes Bank I sold off. I bought it through some suggestion in youtube. Initially did some mistakes. Right now my portfolio is doing fine with 25% returns thanks to Tata Power and Tata Elxsi but other share didn't gave much returns.

Initially I was fine with long term investing. But now I realised why people say that you need patience. Stocks not growing. Many shares are stagnant over months like HDFC Bank. I trust all my shares but it's just funny. I felt slight impatience yesterday. So, I am writing this. 

My biggest investment is in CDSL. That share is in loss. Average price is around 1330. I thought ki with time more people will come to share market. But ya dividends are good.

I am just randomly writing all these. I stopped watching market for 1.5 months. Returned only to see my portfolio below what was there 1.5 months back.

I think it will go even lower. Ukraine- Russia won't stop. Thanks USA for fucking up the whole world. I should be happy that market is low. One can buy more. But already all spare money gone buying in lower valuation. War will continue for sure. Yesterday they destroyed Kerch bridge which conects Russia to Crimiea.

 Britain economy is going down. So does Europe. Less IT orders from them means less income for IT companies. Every export based company will take hit. 

One good thing is that India sold weapons to Armenia. But thse weapons are made by DRDO not any listed company. Still, it pushes made in India. It will improve India's image as weapon exporter. Great for HAL,etc. But I am not going to buy any company with high stakes of government. CDSL is somewhat of an exception though.

I just wanted to write something. So, I am simply writing. Ignore all these.

More rate hikes by federal bank and RBI are coming. Government extended PMGKAY to give poor more ration. They are extending it for 2 years now. Poor get all stuff free. Atleast reduce tax for middle class the. But na. We are less in numbers. We are not vote bank and we don't give money in party fund like Corporates. nice. When company is already paid taxes on their profit. Why are you asking capital gain tax from shareholders? Isn't this double taxation. Middle class ke kapde utarne he to bol do. Hum apne aap utar denge.

Indian companies should start entering Africa and control the space before Chinese enters. 

I feel sad for my Tata Motors investment. 2nd biggest investment after CDSL. Europe in recession, so JLR market will be affected. So, it won't pick up for next few years. Many shares I can't buy because I am poor. Ahh. I am tired. Kal ki utri nahi shayad. By the way liquor company are good too. Need to study them."

1. üè¢üí∞Real estate has been a major contributor to India's economic growth 

Listed real estate companies in India have reported strong numbers

but the sector has not created wealth in the Indian markets. 

I have explored the the state of listed real estate companies and their future prospects here:

2. üìäüìâ Over the last few years, real estate companies have seen a huge erosion in share price due to the sector facing headwinds due to several factors, including a slowdown in demand, oversupply, and lack of financing options. Regulatory changes like RERA have brought in transparency and accountability but have also led to delays in project approvals

3. üìäüìâ The BSE Realty Index has underperformed the broader markets, individual real estate companies have seen varied stock performances:

1 year performance 

DLF = 0.37%

Godrej Properties -27%

Macrotech Developers = -19%

Sobha Developers = -34.81%

4. üéâüìà There have been positive developments in the sector, let‚Äôs have a look:

A. All-time high sales in major cities based on strong demand

Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said that Q1CY23 saw an all-time high of over 114,000 units sold, breaking all records and breaching the 100,000 units mark for the first tim

Godrej Properties and Sobha Developers have reported their highest ever quarterly and annual sales in Q4FY23 and FY 2022-23.

https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/housing-inventory-overhang-lowest-in-5-years-on-the-back-of-robust-sales-123041000258\_1.html 

B. Reserve Bank of India's recent decision not to hike interest rates, have led to a positive outlook for the real estate sector.

After six consecutive hikes, the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs decision on Thursday to keep the repo rate of 6.50 per cent unchanged came as a huge relief to the real estate industry as well as home buyers paying back home loans.

C. Increasing institutional investment inflows   
 Investment inflows in Indian real estate have increased by 37% YoY in Q1 2023, with domestic funding up four times. This suggests a growing investor interest in the sector.

D. Housing inventory overhang lowest in 5 years on the back of robust sales 

The housing inventory overhang in the top seven cities in India stood at a five-year low of 20 months at the end of the January-March quarter, data from real estate consultancy Anarock  

Source: https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/housing-inventory-overhang-lowest-in-5-years-on-the-back-of-robust-sales-123041000258\_1.html

E. Strong economic growth of India 

Sobha developers in its results reported the strong growth on the back of India‚Äôs positive economic environment. 

5. Despite these positive developments, there are still risks that could impact the sector, such as oversupply, regulatory changes, and the liquidity crunch. However, with the real estate sector becoming more stable, with fly-by-night companies out of the picture due to regulatory changes such as RERA, and companies buying land banks, it remains to see whether the sector could outperform in the future."

But ever since the double top that happened on the daily chart, back in January, Wipro has only been going one way. DOWN!!!   


[Wipro Analysis](https://preview.redd.it/ybqerza832p91.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=9338c1e94644a2566408ce5121b80f792ac3ecee)

  
But after moving sideways for more than 60 days, WIPRO is getting ready for another leg down. There are two factors fuelling this move.   
**1. Technical Reason** \- Classic Head & Shoulders forming on the daily chart, which can take the price down to 370. But again, we will not go there in one go. There will be multiple support along the way. But this 370 is coinciding with the 161.8 Fib level as well.

**2. Fundamental Reason-** As we all know, globally interest rates have been going up. This will impact the IT companies hardest and we are already seeing this. With the recent hike from the Fed around the corner, in which a hike of 0.75% to 1.00% seems possible, the global IT companies will bleed heavily and Wipro will be no exception.   


In such a scenario, what should be your strategy? Well, TBH, it depends on at least a couple of factors.   
1. **Your Risk Tolerance and**  
2. **Your Timeframe**  


If you are willing to stay for the next decade or so, this might be an opportunity of a lifetime to accumulate few fundamentally strong stocks. I'll keep sharing them here as well as on some of our channels as well.

Why the US yield curve is spooking investors?,28,vk8s02,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/vk8s02/why_the_us_yield_curve_is_spooking_investors/,1656138651.0,8,"The US Federal Reserve increased rates by 75 bps (0.75%) on June 15th - the largest hike since 1994! This is the second rate hike in a 2-month window, the earlier one being a 50 bps hike in early May. And according to the US Fed Governor, Jerome Powell, another rate hike of 50-75 bps¬†is likely next month. Of course, the aggressive hikes in the US are being executed to combat inflation levels the country hasn't seen in multiple decades.

Equity markets around the world have witnessed¬†a massive sell-off - the S&P 500 and Nifty 50 are¬†24% and 18% lower than their 52-week highs respectively.  While it's not unusual for money to move away from equity markets in a high interest rate environment, there is something else that's spooked investors around the world: the **inverted yield curve**! 

Here is a brief on how the yield curve works, what it means for the economy and why it's important for investors to pay heed!

 **The US yield curve**

Let's take a look at what the yield curve in the US looks¬†like now and at how it's changed over the last 6 months. 

https://preview.redd.it/snerqql1op791.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f353df076b2715535630d7c1600ce10e7387d7

As you can see, the yield curve shape (between 2 year to 10 year) has gone from having an increasing shape to flat lining to inverting to a decreasing shape in April 2022!  This means that the short term (e.g. 2 year) borrowing rate is higher than the long term (e.g. 10 year) borrowing rate -¬†which represents¬†the market expectation of¬†a lower interest rate environment in the long term due to an economic¬†slowdown. 

**Unfortunately, the inverting of a¬†yield curve is considered a strong indicator of an impending recession.** 

Let's see how effective yield curves have been in predicting recessions. To ground this, we'll look at how the yield curve changed **prior to the 2008 recession**. The chart below plots the 10y minus 2y 'spread' for the time period prior to the recession. 

https://preview.redd.it/cxty49olop791.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=7967e8991becc5655ff8b5020d03563ceaeb4d2c

Interestingly, the yield curves inverted (10y-2y turned negative) prior to the 2008 recession. In other words, the inverted yields in 2006 &¬†2007 were¬†leading indicators of the 2008 recession. 

https://preview.redd.it/62w4j3poop791.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e7cde158cea0b8c1573fb5c0851d9a5d9081d5a

**Given what we've seen in the past, the inversion of the yield curve might be an indicator that¬†the US economy is headed into a recession - exactly what has spooked investors all over the world, causing¬†market sell-offs.**

**Good Morning**

On Wednesday, Indian equities benchmarks closed at two-month lows, as the market fell for the sixth session in a row. Globally, investors were cautious due to concerns about sharp rate rises and their impact on economic development.

The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indexes dipped 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, while the **India VIX, or fear index, rose 2.44 percent to 22.10 levels.**

According to the notion of polarity change, the Nifty is currently placed at the **critical support level of 16,800**. This level has historically been a critical value region, with big changes from both its supports and resistances.

The Nifty's major **support level is set at 16800, followed by 16,650**. If the index continues to rise, the major **resistance levels to monitor are 17,000 and 17,150.**

**Bank Nifty:**

On September 28, the Nifty Bank index fell 599 points to 37,760 and created a bearish candle on the daily charts. The pivot point, which will serve as **critical support for the index, is set at 37,450, followed by 37,200.** The important **resistance levels on the upside are 38,250 and 38,700.**

**SGX Nifty:**

Trends on the SGX Nifty show a solid start for India's wider market, with a **0.93 percent rise of 153 points. At 8:10 a.m**., the Nifty futures were trading at **17,046 on the Singapore market.**

**US Market:**

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 548.75 points, or 1.88%, to close at 29,683.74. The S&P 500 rose 1.97% to 3,719.04. At the closing, the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.05% at 11,051.64.

**At 8:15 a.m., the Dow futures are down 78 points to 29671.**

**Asian Market:**

At 7:30 a.m. on Thursday, the Nikkei rose 0.93 percent, while the Shanghai index climbed 0.81 percent. The Topix index increased by 0.31%. The Kospi increased by 1.5%.

**Call/Put OI data:**

According to exchange statistics, the biggest call open interest is gathered at the strike price of 17,000, with 1.9 lakh contracts, and the next highest at 17,500, with 1.7 lakh. The maximum put open interest, on the other hand, is set at 16,800, 16,500, and 16,000 strikes, with 1.1 lakh contracts apiece.

This implies that there will be significant resistance above 17,000 and strong support at 16,800, followed by 16,500.

**Oil:**

Brent oil price gained 0.02 percent to touch $89.34 a barrel at 7:30 am on Thursday.

**Rupee:**

Due to massive currency withdrawals, the rupee fell below the 82 mark for the first time on Wednesday before settling down by 40 paise at 81.93 versus the US dollar."

**Good Morning**

Indian equity benchmarks closed in the green on Monday, following cautious gains in most other major markets around the world, as investors weighed hawkish remarks by Fed officials against a better-than-expected US consumer inflation reading last week, which rekindled hopes of an earlier end to interest rate hikes.

According to the general price structure and data backed by indicators, the **Nifty will continue to rise and will reach the level of 18,500, followed by the 18,650 mark**. The optimistic stance, however, would be undermined if it falls below the 18,280 mark.

The Nifty's important **support level is 18,300, followed by 18,280 and 18,200**. If the index rises, the **significant resistance levels to monitor are 18,450, 18,480, and 18,530.**

**Bank Nifty:**

On Thursday, Indian equity indexes halted a two-day winning streak due to losses in banking, IT, and auto stocks, but gains in oil and gas counters held the downside in control. The Nifty50 closed six points below 18,350, a level cited by several experts as near-term support.

Nifty is presently trading at the bottom end of its four-session range. Positive chart patterns such as higher tops and bottoms have been maintained on the daily chart, and additional consolidation/weakness from here is expected to be the sequence's higher bottom.

Following a two-day decline, Indian stock indexes staged a robust return on Friday, powered by gains across sectors, matching a jump in global counterparts after a softer-than-expected US inflation estimate fuelled optimism that the Fed may reduce the frequency and amount of interest rate hikes.

With fears of at least a modest global recession, major central banks have been hurrying to boost benchmark interest rates in order to cool red-hot inflation.

Nifty has forcefully closed over the **critical resistance level of 18,150 and is on the verge of going above another resistance level of 18,350.**

Next for banks - Retail? MSME? Corporates?,2,xzlo6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/xzlo6z/next_for_banks_retail_msme_corporates/,1665322088.0,1,"*The US Federal reserve hiked interest rates by 75 bps on 21st September. This is the 3rd hike since June, and it appears there are more¬†hikes yet to come - the Fed has clearly signaled aggressive¬†rate hikes to battle inflation. This battle might cause a recession not only in¬†the US but in other developed economies with high levels of inflation as well.* 

*The RBI¬†has followed the Fed, though the quantum of our rate hikes have¬†been lower.* 

*However, even if the global economy enters a recession, India is very well positioned. We've done a great job of keeping inflation under control and our GDP is estimated to grow¬†by 7.4% in FY23 (IMF estimates).¬†But it's not just inflation control, there is more to cheer about!* 

*Our banking ecosystem has never been better. With NPAs at multi-year lows, banks are well positioned to accelerate¬†the credit growth engine.*

*This time, we think the growth cycle will be different. Read on to learn why!* 

**Banking sector - the past and the present**

**Lending in the past 2 decades**

**Corporate lending growth & blow up:** Let's start with how the banking ecosystem has evolved over the last \~15 years.  Post the great recession of 2008, corporate lending saw significant growth in India - and this happened at the expense of retail lending. Here is a chart demonstrating corporate lending growth between 2009-2013. 

https://preview.redd.it/qx1p5ftt2ss91.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=00e7dafb1684e6006f838628763e974fc26ace1a

This growth in corporate lending led to significant risk increases in bank corporate loan books - this was due to a combination of¬†inefficient underwriting by banks and corporates over leveraging themselves. Here is a chart showing GNPA numbers across the largest set of banks in India.

https://preview.redd.it/1i1qymxu2ss91.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=a96130ed3c99134e43523a52a2e8c4184ea04bda

PCA Framework: This forced RBI to put a bunch of banks under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The PCA assessed banks across three parameters - losses (NPA), capital (CRAR) and returns (ROA). Once a bank enters PCA, they aren't allowed to grow¬†their books until they get their house in order, i.e. bring¬†risk levels down, capitalize¬†their balance sheet and start making profits. 

Growth in retail lending: Given the corporate lending blow up, the banking ecosystem reduced their exposure towards corporate loans and moved towards retail lending - retail penetration ramped up significantly from 2015 on. 

https://preview.redd.it/dekg6s543ss91.png?width=1036&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad1ddd7b271170b6582c5f7ea89fb4bd918048c7

**The banking industry today**

The banking ecosystem has cleaned up house over the last several years, and GNPA has come down to multi-year lows. Here are GNPA levels for the largest public and private sector banks. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e4s8z4193ss91.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee15812e4d78dd93a1149b89b8252619ff18815

All banks put under the PCA framework have now exited the framework. The last one to exit was Central Bank of India (CBI) 

 Let's look at the GNPAs for some of the banks that were in the PCA framework. While these banks still have work to do, their asset quality has seen significant improvement over the last few years. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d51z6obe3ss91.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=f432974e44aaea7c9b3616661478fe884983bcf0

With low GNPAs across the banking ecosystem, banks have the appetite for¬†credit growth over the next few years. The last cycle of growth came from retail lending; where will this cycle of growth come from? 

 

**Retail growth: driven by unsecured lending**  


Given the low GNPA levels across the board, banks have the appetite to absorb¬†risk. So¬†banks with good asset quality are well positioned to take bets in the unsecured retail space - including credit cards and unsecured personal loans.

And this is exactly what larger private banks like Kotak, Axis and ICICI are doing - here is a snapshot of their retail segment growth in Q1FY23. 

https://preview.redd.it/a9f7c8nm3ss91.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb9159dbd0d7db2be4ca63f3f053192986224952

 And unsecured lending has seen a large spike in the last few months.  
 

https://preview.redd.it/mrwb345q3ss91.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6b9d970d6fcda3973d286cbe8fda779c02852f4

With GNPA numbers bottoming out, we expect this trend to continue over the next few years. We not only¬†see retail growing from here on, but¬†also expect the retail mix of unsecured loans and credit cards to meaningfully increase. 

**Corporate growth: driven by the twin balance sheet clean up** 

Firstly, corporate demand is back, which means demand for credit is going to increase.

To demonstrate this, let's look at industry level Capacity utilization (CU). As the name suggests, this metric represents the % of¬†manufacturing capacity utilized for production. Higher the CU, higher the demand¬†and higher the need for capital investment,¬†and therefore higher credit need. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mt0qjj334ss91.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=dba201e3f37ecdf2cfd03d24af59fb86cf77204f

https://preview.redd.it/pn7vfl524ss91.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=014c659ae05d9d6bc8f89a174dfe647005449bce

Corporates have significantly de-leveraged their balance sheets,¬†here is some data to back this up.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5wplcjo74ss91.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=adeda2bc533c8f8a5c5f04be3871a3d21cb2504c

So not just banks, corporates have also cleaned up their balance sheets. This twin balance sheet clean-up makes corporate lending an attractive proposition¬†for banks at this time. 

 **MSME growth: driven by post-pandemic recovery**  
 

https://preview.redd.it/2gfweksf4ss91.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=b31e6201b5ee47d3c9394938d87338e2d8ff3f19

Clearly, MSME risk recovery hasn't happened across the board. While risk levels for private banks seem to have come back to pre-pandemic levels, PSUs and NBFCs still have some more cleaning up to do.

Given this, we expect private sector banks to grow their MSME books, and this seems to be happening.   
 

https://preview.redd.it/ipqfiv5l4ss91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7cdb540acb893dd774248a6d0f12074ff802eb

*The world might be facing an impending recession, but we don't think India is!*  
*Not only are our banks well positioned to grow over the next several years, but we expect this growth to benefit all segments - retail, MSME and corporate!*  
*What do you think about our assessment? Are you bullish about banks' prospects?*

The largest put open interest, on the other hand, is at 17,000, with 1.2 lakh contracts, and at 17,500, with 1.1 lakh.

The market appears to be on solid ground, as the benchmark indices extended their strong rally for a third consecutive session on July 29, with the Nifty50 decisively closing above the psychological 17,100 mark, backed by FII inflows and buying across sectors following the Federal Reserve's signal to slow the pace of rate increases.

The prospect of less aggressive Fed rate hikes in the coming months than previously anticipated boosted global sentiment.

Fresh positions are recommended only on dips, with a stop-loss below 17,020 levels on a closing basis, as consolidation above the 200-day SMA for a few sessions can eventually lead to higher targets of 17,500 levels.

**Bank Nifty:**

US Market:

Wall Street indices rose on Friday as positive corporate news offset concerns about rising labor costs and other signs of ongoing inflation. The S&P 500 gained 1.4 percent, the Dow Jones gained one percent, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9 percent.

Call/Put Open Interest :

The maximum call open interest is accumulated at the strike price of 17,600, with nearly 98,000 contracts, and the next highest at 18,000, with 94,000 contracts, according to exchange data. On the flip side, the maximum put open interest is at 17,000, with 1.2 lakh contracts, and 16,900, with 94,000 contracts.

Technically, the Nifty has been trading consistently below 16,000 and below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which is negative. Before closing off the day's low, the Nifty corrected towards the lower band of the rising channel. The index remained below significant moving averages on the daily chart.

The index is clinging to a lower top formation on intraday charts, indicating short-term weakness.

The key resistance level for bulls will be 16,000, and above it, the index can move to 16,100-16,150. On the downside, 15,850 will be the key support level, and if it is breached, the index could fall to 15,800-15,725."

**Our take for Next week's market:**

The hourly chart shows that the index has moved lower from the upper end of a rising channel.

The index's near-term support zone is 15850-15900. If that level is breached, the index may fall towards 15500. From a trading standpoint, short-term traders should sell on the rise if the price breaks above the swing high of 16275.

The Nifty ended the day at 16,049.20, up 0.7 percent. Most sectors traded in tandem, with autos, consumer durables, and capital goods leading the way. The broader indexes rose by 0.6 percent to 0.9 percent.

In early trade on Monday, markets will first react to HDFC Bank's results. Furthermore, the performance of global indices, particularly those in the United States, as well as the movement of crude oil, will be closely monitored by participants. Overall, we recommend maintaining a positive but cautious stance until the Nifty falls below 15,900 and focusing more on stock selection."

My first post here so please bear with me and all the feedback is welcome.

Nifty has been ranging and consolidating in a triangle since mid-Dec fall. It has taken support from 16800 from Nov'21. To get the target for the fall, it comes at around 15600. My reasoning being -

\-- This target also coincides with its support line for the whole of June and July'21.

\--the trend-based fib-extensions 1.618 also come at exactly this level.

\--The '1' of the same extension comes at 16500 - another key support which is now broken.

[ Target Price of the fall - Breakdown from triangle, trend-based fib and previous support all conforming to 15.6 being the next destination. ](https://preview.redd.it/eb2kui5pwqj81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4455d710ad06a27a2b8fea883e2db68b8006657c)

If any of you use MarketCipher or Wumanchu-B you must have seen they have a money indicator flow built-in. The last time NIFTY moved from green MF to Red on daily timeframe, Nifty dropped 8.7%. We are in the process of moving from green to red money flow again. . Back then, there wasn't as much bearish news as we have today. However, this time we have Fed-hike, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, FII dumping and inflation make this more bearish.

Indian stock market rally made investors richer by Rs 72 lakh crore in 2021,18,rs0frp,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/rs0frp/indian_stock_market_rally_made_investors_richer/,1640866434.0,0," As if wanting to be an antidote to the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian stock market adorned carnival robes in 2021 with a tsunami of liquidity unleashed by global central banks coupled with supportive domestic policies and the world‚Äôs largest vaccination drive sparking off a world-beating rally on Dalal Street, despite bouts of uneasiness over fizzy valuations.

While the wider economy shuttled between recovery and relapse, dictated by multiple mutations of the virus, equity market benchmarks appeared headed in just one direction ‚Äî skywards.

The dizzying upward journey has added a whopping Rs 72 lakh crore during 2021 to investors‚Äô wealth, measured as the cumulative value of all listed shares in the country, taking it to nearly Rs 260 lakh crore.

In Indian stock market the BSE Sensex made history this year by breaching the 50,000-mark for the first time ever, and went on to scale the 60,000 level within the next seven months. It closed at its lifetime high of 61,765.59 on October 18.

Despite the year-end gyrations due to the Omicron threat, the 30-share benchmark has posted returns of nearly 20 per cent so far this year, eclipsing most of its global peers.

However, Sensex is also the most expensive large market in the world, trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.11.

This means investors are paying Rs 27.11 for every rupee of future earnings of the 30 Sensex firms, compared to its previous 20-year average of 19.80. But, the Indian market is not the only one witnessing such exuberance.

Global central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, have pumped in trillions of dollars into the financial markets since the onset of the pandemic to boost liquidity and prop up growth.

The US Fed has been buying bonds worth USD 120 every month for the past one-and-a-half years, nearly doubling its balance sheet to an astounding USD 8.3 trillion.

This unprecedented sea of liquidity has induced what experts have termed the ‚Äòeverything bubble‚Äô ‚Äî an across-the-board increase in asset prices, be it stocks, real estate or commodities, not to mention more exotic instruments like crypto-currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Back home, the government and the RBI worked in tandem to reignite the animal spirit of the pandemic-battered economy.

The Reserve Bank has kept the policy rate at an all-time low of 4 per cent since May last year, while reiterating its commitment to maintaining an accommodative stance as long as required.

The Centre unleashed a slew of big bang reforms, including production-linked incentive schemes for multiple sectors, a Rs 100 lakh-crore PM Gati Shakti Master Plan for infrastructure development and an ambitious asset monetisation pipeline, among various other measures.

All this played out amid a colossal vaccination drive which enabled the reopening of the economy after the shock of COVID-19 lockdowns.

‚ÄúThe year started on a wave of optimism with the start of the vaccination program and the sharp revival of the economy. However, the intensity of the second wave tempered some of this initial optimism. This was soon followed by the return of inflation, led primarily by supply chain disruptions,‚Äù said Nitin Raheja, Executive Director, Head ‚Äì Discretionary Equities, Julius Baer.

However, strong commitment on the part of central banks, both globally and domestically, towards ensuring strong revival in growth through the continuation of easy money policies saw liquidity remaining benign, fuelling strong inflows into financial markets and other risky assets, he noted.

‚ÄúMulti-year low-interest rates, new generation reforms, adequate availability of capital and the revival of the real estate sector have created the framework for a multi-year earnings growth cycle, ‚Äù Raheja added.

Despite all these factors in favour, the market has a habit of teaching some very old lessons to some very new investors.

One such lesson was that valuations and fundamentals matter ‚Äî as evidenced by the disastrous market debut of Paytm.

The Rs 18,300-crore IPO, India‚Äôs largest, was one of the most hyped listings in recent times and a major milestone in the country‚Äôs startup ecosystem.

However, in Indian stock market, the stock crashed 27 per cent on the very first day, and continued sinking in subsequent sessions. Currently trading in the range of Rs 1,360, the stock is yet to touch its issue price of Rs 2,150.

That apart, the coronavirus remains an unpredictable adversary for investors worldwide.

Just when countries had started reopening and the global economy was getting back on track, the highly-contagious Omicron variant emerged, triggering a fresh wave of cases and border restrictions.

With soaring inflation playing havoc with economies the world over, central banks too have started to dial back their stimulus measures.

The Fed has already begun tapering its bond-buying, and will wind down the quantitative easing program by early next year, to be followed by rate hikes.

The Bank of England earlier this month became the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the onset of the pandemic.

The tightening of ultra-loose monetary policies has subsequently led to a flight of foreign capital from emerging markets, including India.

After being net investors for the most part of the year, FPIs have been on a selling spree since October, offloading shares worth Rs 37,320 crore (as of December 24).

The relentless selling pressure, however, has been partially offset by a growing force in the domestic financial landscape ‚Äì the retail investor.

Inflows from systematic investment plans (SIPs) crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the first time this year, as per data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI).

Individual investors hold a higher share of the MF industry assets (54.9 per cent in November 2021, compared to 51.5 per cent in the same month last year). Not only that, 77 per cent of individual investor assets are held in equity-oriented schemes.

In Indian stock market the Investors are not shying away from direct participation in the equity markets as well.

While the number of demat accounts stood at 4.09 crore at the end of 2019-20 and 5.51 crore in 2020-21, the figure has already swelled to 7.38 crore this fiscal so far (as of October 31, 2021).

‚ÄúThe aftermath of the world‚Äôs biggest ever easy monetary policy and fiscal expenditure made equities attractive, and the equity market benefited even more as the economy re-opened. Increased money inflows in the financial system bought foreign money to emerging markets.

‚ÄúThe cascading effect of profits bought retail investors to the equity market, a global affair. Indirectly, pandemic did help some Indian economy sectors like IT, healthcare and exporters, (which) benefited from digitalization and global demand,‚Äù said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Adhering to the adage of making hay while the sun shines, Indian Inc too piled into the capital market with initial public offers (IPOs), raising a record-shattering Rs 1.18 lakh crore from over 60 issues.

The Street saw more initial share sales in 2021 than in the year past three years combined, both in terms of the number of listings and the amount raised.

With such high spirits all around, many market participants are asking themselves an uncomfortable question ‚Äî how long will the good times last?

Most brokerages expect Sensex to post tepid returns in 2022, weighed by the already stretched valuations, hawkish central banks and an uncertain global recovery.

The looming threat of Omicron setting off another wave of the pandemic is the biggest short-term risk. But faith in the underlying India story remains intact.

‚ÄúWe think strong growth forecast in the medium term should support the valuations. We like the stability of macroeconomic parameters that should support consumption and investments, leading to continued earnings estimate upgrades,‚Äù analysts at BNP Paribas said earlier this month.

The party, it seems, for now, is destined to carry on."
